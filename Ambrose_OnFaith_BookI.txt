  Preface.

   On the eve of setting out for the East, to aid his uncle Valens in
   repelling a Gothic invasion, Gratian, the Emperor of the West,
   requested St. Ambrose to write him a treatise in proof of the Divinity
   of Jesus Christ. Gratian's object in making this request was to secure
   some sort of preservative against the corrupting influence of Arianism,
   which at that time (a.d. 378) had gained the upper hand of Orthodoxy in
   the Eastern provinces of the Empire, owing to its establishment at the
   Imperial Court. In compliance with Gratian's wish, the Bishop of Milan
   composed a treatise, which now forms the first two Books of the De
   Fide. With this work the Emperor was so much pleased that on his return
   from the East, after the death of Valens at Hadrianople, he wrote to
   St. Ambrose, begging for a fresh copy of the treatise, and further, for
   its enlargement by the addition of a discourse on the Divinity of the
   Holy Spirit. The original treatise was, indeed, enlarged by St. Ambrose
   in 379, but the additional Books dealt, not with the Divinity of the
   Holy Spirit, but rather with new objections raised by the Arian
   teachers, and points which had either been passed over or not fully
   discussed already. In this way St. Ambrose's Exposition was brought
   into its present form.

   The object of the Exposition is, as has already been indicated, to
   prove the Divinity of Jesus Christ, and His co-eternity, co-equality,
   and consubstantiality, as God the Son, with God the Father. This the
   author does by constant appeal to the Scriptures, both of the Old and
   of the New Testament, which the Arians had in many cases forced into
   the mould of false interpretation to make them fit their doctrine.

   Besides the title of De Fide, that of De Trinitate was one by which
   this treatise was largely known in after ages; it is certain, though,
   that the former was that assigned by St. Ambrose himself.

  Prefatory Note.

   The notes to the first four books of the De Fide have in some instances
   been taken over from those in Father Hurter's Edition of the treatise
   (Innsbruck: Wagner), which has been used in preparing the translation
   of these books. These notes are distinguished by the letter "H." placed
   at the end.

   The citations from Scripture embodied in the text have been translated
   as they stood in the original. This will account for any divergence
   from the renderings in the English Bible and Prayer-book, whilst any
   agreement may be set down to reminiscences of the more familiar
   versions. It was thought best to adopt this treatment of St. Ambrose's
   citations, inasmuch as the divergences are worth noticing, and indeed,
   in some cases, the argument rather turns upon them. The references are,
   throughout, made to chapters and verses in the English Bible, and not
   to the Vulgate, unless especially stated so to be.

   The Prefaces and Summaries of Contents are based on those in Father
   Hurter's Edition.

    Prologue.

   The author praises Gratian's zeal for instruction in the Faith, and
   speaks lowly of his own merits. Taught of God Himself, the Emperor
   stands in no need of human instruction; yet this his devoutness
   prepares the way to victory. The task appointed to the author is
   difficult: in the accomplishment whereof he will be guided not so much
   by reason and argument as by authority, especially that of the Nicene
   Council.

   1. The Queen of the South, as we read in the Book of the Kings, came to
   hear the wisdom of Solomon. [1661] Likewise King Hiram sent to Solomon
   that he might prove him. [1662] So also your sacred Majesty, following
   these examples of old time, has decreed to hear my confession of faith.
   But I am no Solomon, that you should wonder at my wisdom, and your
   Majesty is not the sovereign of a single people; it is the Augustus,
   ruler of the whole world, that has commanded the setting forth of the
   Faith in a book, not for your instruction, but for your approval.

   2. For why, august Emperor, should your Majesty learn that Faith which,
   from your earliest childhood, you have ever devoutly and lovingly kept?
   "Before I formed thee in thy mother's belly I knew thee," saith the
   Scripture, "and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified
   thee." [1663] Sanctification, therefore, cometh not of tradition, but
   of inspiration; therefore keep watch over the gifts of God. For that
   which no man hath taught you, God hath surely given and inspired.

   3. Your sacred Majesty, being about to go forth to war, requires of me
   a book, expounding the Faith, since your Majesty knows that victories
   are gained more by faith in the commander, than by valour in the
   soldiers. For Abraham led into battle three hundred and eighteen men,
   [1664] and brought home the spoils of countless foes; and having, by
   the power of that which was the sign of our Lord's Cross and Name,
   [1665] overcome the might of five kings and conquering hosts, he both
   avenged his neighbour and gained victory and the ransom of his
   brother's son. So also Joshua the son of Nun, when he could not prevail
   against the enemy with the might of all his army, [1666] overcame by
   sound of seven sacred trumpets, in the place where he saw and knew the
   Captain of the heavenly host. [1667] For victory, then, your Majesty
   makes ready, being Christ's loyal servant and defender of the Faith,
   which you would have me set forth in writing.

   4. Truly, I would rather take upon me the duty of exhortation to keep
   the Faith, than that of disputing thereon; for the former means devout
   confession, whereas the latter is liable to rash presumption. Howbeit,
   forasmuch as your Majesty has no need of exhortation, whilst I may not
   pray to be excused from the duty of loyalty, I will take in hand a bold
   enterprise, yet modestly withal, not so much reasoning and disputing
   concerning the Faith as gathering together a multitude of witness.
   [1668]

   5. Of the Acts of Councils, I shall let that one be my chief guide
   which three hundred and eighteen priests, appointed, as it were, after
   the judgment of Abraham, [1669] made (so to speak) a trophy raised to
   proclaim their victory over the infidel throughout the world,
   prevailing by that courage of the Faith, wherein all agreed. Verily, as
   it seems to me, one may herein see the hand of God, forasmuch as the
   same number is our authority in the Councils of the Faith, and an
   example of loyalty in the records of old.

   [1663] "By sanctification is meant the grace of regeneration, which
   comprises virtues inspired, including both the habit of faith and the
   gifts of the Holy Spirit. Now these support especially the innocent
   soul, so that with pious affection it nurses the doctrine revealed to
   it, is inclined thereto, loves it, takes it to itself, and advances in
   it."--Hurter ad loc. The Emperor's constant zeal in defence of the
   Faith against the Arians is to be regarded as due to his habit of faith
   and to the gifts of the Spirit. The citation is from Jeremiah i. 5.

   Eighteen was represented by ie, the first two letters of the name

   some mysterious power in the number 318, represented by the sign of the
   Cross and the first two letters of the Saviour's name, thus--TIH.

   [1669] See the note 2 on § 3. St. Ambrose is here speaking of the
   OEcumenical Council held at Nicæa in Bithynia, a.d. 325. Different
   accounts are given of the numbers present. Eusebius says there were 250
   bishops in the Council; Athanasius and Socrates, "more than 300;"
   Sozomen "about 320." The number 318, however, is also given by
   Athanasius as well as by Theodoret and Epiphanius. See Robertson's
   History of the Church, Bk. II. ch. i. The victory over the infidel is,
   of course, the victory of the orthodox Catholics over Arius, and the
   Nicene Symbol may be regarded as the "trophy" commemorating the
   victory, the reality of which lay in getting the clause "of one
   substance with the Father" (homoousion to Patri) subscribed to. The
   original Nicene Creed, it may be useful to observe, was not exactly the
   same in form as the symbol which now is generally known by that name,
   and which is part of the Eucharistic office of the English Church. This
   latter is an enlargement of the original, and it appears to have been
   in use for a considerable time (not less than seventy years) before it
   was produced at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. It obtained general
   acceptance by the middle of the sixth century. Towards the end of that
   century (589 a.d.) an additional clause, proclaiming the procession of
   the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as the Father, was inserted at the
   Council of Toledo. This insertion was repudiated by the Church in the
   East, and became one of the causes of the separation of Eastern from
   Western Christendom.

    Chapter I.

   The author distinguishes the faith from the errors of Pagans, [1670]
   Jews, and Heretics, and after explaining the significance of the names
   "God" and "Lord," shows clearly the difference of Persons in Unity of
   Essence. [1671]  In dividing the Essence, the Arians not only bring in
   the doctrine of three Gods, but even overthrow the dominion of the
   Trinity.

   6. Now this is the declaration of our Faith, that we say that God is
   One, neither dividing His Son from Him, as do the heathen, [1672] nor
   denying, with the Jews, that He was begotten of the Father before all
   worlds, [1673] and afterwards born of the Virgin; nor yet, like
   Sabellius, [1674] confounding the Father with the Word, and so
   maintaining that Father and Son are one and the same Person; nor again,
   as doth Photinus, [1675] holding that the Son first came into existence
   in the Virgin's womb: nor believing, with Arius, [1676] in a number of
   diverse Powers, [1677] and so, like the benighted heathen, making out
   more than one God. For it is written: "Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God
   is one God." [1678]

   7. For God and Lord is a name of majesty, a name of power, even as God
   Himself saith: "The Lord is My name," [1679] and as in another place
   the prophet declareth: "The Lord Almighty is His name." [1680] God is
   He, therefore, and Lord, either because His rule is over all, or
   because He beholdeth all things, and is feared by all, without
   difference. [1681]

   8. If, then, God is One, one is the name, one is the power, of the
   Trinity. Christ Himself, indeed, saith: "Go ye, baptize the nations in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." [1682]
   In the name, mark you, not in the names." [1683]

   9. Moreover, Christ Himself saith: "I and the Father are One." [1684]
   "One," said He, that there be no separation of power and nature; but
   again, "We are," that you may recognize Father and Son, forasmuch as
   the perfect Father is believed to have begotten the perfect Son, [1685]
   and the Father and the Son are One, not by confusion of Person, but by
   unity of nature. [1686]

   10. We say, then, that there is one God, not two or three Gods, this
   being the error into which the impious heresy of the Arians doth run
   with its blasphemies. For it says that there are three Gods, in that it
   divides the Godhead of the Trinity; whereas the Lord, in saying, "Go,
   baptize the nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Spirit," hath shown that the Trinity is of one power. We confess
   Father, Son, and Spirit, understanding in a perfect Trinity both
   fulness of Divinity and unity of power. [1687]

   11. "Every kingdom divided against itself shall quickly be overthrown,"
   saith the Lord. Now the kingdom of the Trinity is not divided. If,
   therefore, it is not divided, it is one; for that which is not one is
   divided. The Arians, however, would have the kingdom of the Trinity to
   be such as may easily be overthrown, by division against itself. But
   truly, seeing that it cannot be overthrown, it is plainly undivided.
   For no unity is divided or rent asunder, and therefore neither age nor
   corruption has any power over it. [1688]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1670] Or "Gentiles." The Christians regarded themselves as placed in
   the world much as the Hebrews had been planted in the midst of the
   "nations round about."

   [1671] The Latin word is natura, which, at first sight, seems less
   abstruse and metaphysical than the Greek ousia, or hupostasis, or the
   Latin essentia and substantia, though it is not really so. A man's
   natura, nature, is what he is at and from the beginning; "change of
   nature" means not an absolute change, but a reformation, a new guidance
   and treatment of tendencies, passions, powers--some receiving a
   precedence denied them before, others being suppressed and put in
   subjection. So God's "nature" is what He is from and to all eternity,
   in Himself, unchangingly and unchangeably.

   [1672] Lit. "the nations"--gentes, ta ethne. The Romans of the Republic
   used to speak of foreign peoples--especially if subject to kings--as
   gentes exteræ, in contradistinction to the Populus Romanus. St. Ambrose
   of course means those who still clung to the ancient religions, who
   were foreigners to the commonwealth (res publica) of the Church.

   [1673] The original is ante tempora--"before the ages"--"before time
   was." Cf. 1 Cor. viii. 6; Phil. ii. 6-8; Col. i. 15 (prototokos pases
   ktiseos--"first-born of all creation," which Justin Martyr interprets
   as meaning pro panton ton ktismaton--"before all created things.")
   Hebrews i. 1-12; Rev. i. 8, 18; John i. 1-3. Justin Martyr, Apology,
   II. 6; Dialogue with Tryphon, 61. Tempora answers to the Greek aiones,
   rendered "worlds" in Heb. i. 2.

   [1674] Sabellius was a presbyter in the Libyan Pentapolis (Barca), who
   came to Rome and there ventilated his heretical teaching, early in the
   third century, a.d. (about 210). He appears to have maintained that
   there was no real distinction of Persons in the Godhead. God, he said,
   was one individual Person: when different divine Persons were spoken
   of, no more was meant than different aspects of, or the assumption of
   different parts by, the same subject. Sabellius thus started from the
   ordinary usages of the term prosopon as denoting (1) a mask, (2) a
   character or part in a drama. The Latin persona was used in the same
   way. Sabellianism never counted many adherents; its professors were
   called Patripassians, because their doctrine was tantamount to
   asserting that God the Father was crucified.

   [1675] Photinus was a Galatian, who became Bishop of Sirmium (Mitrovitz
   in Slavonia) in the fourth century. He taught that Jesus Christ did not
   exist before His mother Mary, but was begotten of her by Joseph. The
   man Jesus, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting, was
   enlightened and guided by the influence of the Logos, or Divine Reason,
   whereby He became the Son of God, preeminent over all other prophets
   and teachers.

   [1676] Arius was a presbyter of Alexandria; the origin of his heresy,
   however, is, as Cardinal Newman has shown, to be sought in Syria rather
   than in Egypt, in the sophistic method of the Antiochene schools more
   than in the mysticism of the Alexandrian. It was in the year 319 that
   Arius began to attract attention by his heterodox teaching, which led
   eventually to his excommunication. He found favour, however, with men
   of considerable importance in the Church, such as Eusebius of Cæsarea
   in Palestine, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Athanasius of Anazarbus, and
   others. The question was finally discussed in a synod of bishops
   convened, on the summons of the Emperor Constantine, at Nicæa in
   Bithynia. The acts of that Council condemned Arianism--notwithstanding
   which, the heresy prevailed in the East till the reign of Theodosius
   the Great (379-395 a.d.); and having won the acceptance of the Goths,
   it was predominant in Gaul and Italy during the fifth century, and in
   Spain till the Council of Toledo (589 a.d.), and its influence affected
   Christian thought for centuries afterwards--possibly it is not even yet
   dead. Arius urged the following dilemma: "Either the Son is an original
   Divine Essence; if so we must acknowledge two Gods. Or He was created,
   formed, begotten; if so, He is not God in the same sense as the Father
   is God." Arius himself chose the latter alternative, which St. Ambrose
   regarded as a lapse into paganism, with its "gods many and lords many,"
   dii majores and dii minores, and divinities begotten of gods and
   goddesses. Arius's errors are summarized in the anathema appended to
   the original Nicene Creed. "But those who say that there was a time
   when the Son of God was not, or that He had no existence before He was
   begotten, or that He was formed of things non-existent, or who assert
   that the Son of God is of a different substance or essence, or is
   created, mutable, or variable, these men the Catholic and Apostolic
   Church of God holds accursed."

   [1677] Compare Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 16. Hierarchies of "Thrones,
   Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers," were characteristic features
   of the Gnostic systems of the second century. The Gnostics generally
   thought that the world had been created by an inferior, secondary,
   limitary power, identified with the God of the Old Testament, whom they
   distinguished from the true Supreme God.

   [1678] The A.V. of 1611 runs thus: "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is
   one Lord" (Jahveh our God is one Jahveh).

   [1679] Ex. iii. 15.

   [1680] "Ego Dominus; hoe est nomen meum."--Vulg., Is. xlii. 8. "I am
   the Lord, that is My name."--A.V. 1611, ibid.

   [1681] The word Theos, "God," is derived by most authorities from
   theasthai, which means "to look upon." Here we have another derivation
   suggested, viz., from deos, "fear," on this ground that God inspires
   fear.--H. Neither derivation is correct. The best perhaps is given by
   Herodotus (II. 52), viz., from the verb tithemi, to place, set, array,
   the idea being that God is the principal of all order and law.

    Chapter II.

   The Emperor is exhorted to display zeal in the Faith. Christ's perfect
   Godhead is shown from the unity of will and working which He has with
   the Father. The attributes of Divinity are shown to be proper to
   Christ, Whose various titles prove His essential unity, with
   distinction of Person. In no other way can the unity of God be
   maintained.

   12. "Not every one that saith unto Me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven," [1689] saith the Scripture. Faith, therefore,
   august Sovereign, must not be a mere matter of performance, for it is
   written, "The zeal of thine house hath devoured me." [1690] Let us then
   with faithful spirit and devout mind call upon Jesus our Lord, let us
   believe that He is God, to the end that whatever we ask of the Father,
   we may obtain in His name. [1691] For the Father's will is, that He be
   entreated through the Son, the Son's that the Father be entreated.
   [1692]

   13. The grace of His submission makes for agreement [with our
   teaching], and the acts of His power are not at variance therewith. For
   whatsoever things the Father doeth, the same also doeth the Son, in
   like manner. [1693] The Son both doeth the same things, and doeth them
   in like manner, but it is the Father's will that He be entreated in the
   matter of what He Himself proposeth to do, that you may understand, not
   that He cannot do it otherwise, but that there is one power displayed.
   Truly, then, is the Son of God to be adored and worshipped, Who by the
   power of His Godhead hath laid the foundations of the world, and by His
   submission informed our affections. [1694]

   14. Therefore we ought to believe that God is good, eternal, perfect,
   almighty, and true, such as we find Him in the Law and the Prophets,
   and the rest of the holy Scriptures, [1695] for otherwise there is no
   God. For He Who is God cannot but be good, seeing that fulness of
   goodness is of the nature of God: [1696] nor can God, Who made time, be
   in time; nor, again, can God be imperfect, for a lesser being is
   plainly imperfect, seeing that it lacks somewhat whereby it could be
   made equal to a greater. This, then, is the teaching of our faith--that
   God is not evil, that with God nothing is impossible, that God exists
   not in time, that God is beneath no being. If I am in error, let my
   adversaries prove it. [1697]

   15. Seeing, then, that Christ is God, He is, by consequence, good and
   almighty and eternal and perfect and true; for these attributes belong
   to the essential nature of the Godhead. Let our adversaries, therefore,
   deny the Divine Nature in Christ,--otherwise they cannot refuse to God
   what is proper to the Divine Nature.

   16. Further, that none may fall into error, let a man attend to those
   signs vouchsafed us by holy Scripture, whereby we may know the Son. He
   is called the Word, the Son, the Power of God, the Wisdom of God.
   [1698] The Word, because He is without blemish; the Power, because He
   is perfect; the Son, because He is begotten of the Father; the Wisdom,
   because He is one with the Father, one in eternity, one in Divinity.
   Not that the Father is one Person with the Son; between Father and Son
   is the plain distinction that comes of generation; [1699] so that
   Christ is God of God, Everlasting of Everlasting, Fulness of Fulness.
   [1700]

   17. Now these are not mere names, but signs of power manifesting itself
   in works, for while there is fulness of Godhead in the Father, there is
   also fulness of Godhead in the Son, not diverse, but one. The Godhead
   is nothing confused, for it is an unity: nothing manifold, for in it
   there is no difference.

   18. Moreover, if in all them that believed there was, as it is written,
   one soul and one heart: [1701] if every one that cleaveth to the Lord
   is one spirit, [1702] as the Apostle hath said: if a man and his wife
   are one flesh: [1703] if all we mortal men are, so far as regards our
   general nature, of one substance: if this is what the Scripture saith
   of created men, that, being many, they are one, [1704] who can in no
   way be compared to Divine Persons, how much more are the Father and the
   Son one in Divinity, with Whom there is no difference either of
   substance or of will!

   19. For how else shall we say that God is One? Divinity maketh
   plurality, but unity of power debarreth quantity of number, seeing that
   unity is not number, but itself is the principle of all numbers.

    Chapter III.

   By evidence gathered from Scripture the unity of Father and Son is
   proved, and firstly, a passage, taken from the Book of Isaiah, is
   compared with others and expounded in such sort as to show that in the
   Son there is no diversity from the Father's nature, save only as
   regards the flesh; whence it follows that the Godhead of both Persons
   is One. This conclusion is confirmed by the authority of Baruch.

   20. Now the oracles [1705] of the prophets bear witness what close
   unity holy Scripture declares to subsist between the Father and the Son
   as regards their Godhead. For thus saith the Lord of Sabaoth: [1706]
   "Egypt hath laboured, and the commerce of the Ethiopians and Sabeans:
   mighty men shall come over to thee, and shall be thy servants, and in
   thy train shall they follow, bound in fetters, and they shall fall down
   before thee, and to thee shall they make supplication: for God is in
   thee, and there is no God beside thee. For thou art God, and we knew it
   not, O God of Israel." [1707]

   21. Hear the voice of the prophet: "In Thee," he saith, "is God, and
   there is no God beside Thee." How agreeth this with the Arians'
   teaching? They must deny either the Father's or the Son's Divinity,
   unless they believe, once for all, unity of the same Divinity.

   22. "In Thee," saith he, "is God"--forasmuch as the Father is in the
   Son. For it is written, "The Father, Who abideth in Me, Himself
   speaketh," and "The works that I do, He Himself also doeth." [1708] And
   yet again we read that the Son is in the Father, saying, "I am in the
   Father, and the Father in Me." [1709] Let the Arians, if they can, make
   away with this kinship [1710] in nature and unity in work.

   23. There is, therefore, God in God, but not two Gods; for it is
   written that there is one God, [1711] and there is Lord in Lord, [1712]
   but not two Lords, forasmuch as it is likewise written: "Serve not two
   lords." [1713] And the Law saith: "Hear, O Israel! The Lord thy God is
   one God;" [1714] moreover, in the same Testament it is written: "The
   Lord rained from the Lord." [1715] The Lord, it is said, sent rain
   "from the Lord." So also you may read in Genesis: "And God said,--and
   God made," [1716] and, lower down, "And God made man in the image of
   God;" [1717] yet it was not two gods, but one God, that made [man]. In
   the one place, then, as in the other, the unity of operation and of
   name is maintained. For surely, when we read "God of God," [1718] we do
   not speak of two Gods.

   24. Again, you may read in the forty-fourth psalm [1719] how the
   prophet not only calls the Father "God" but also proclaims the Son as
   God, saying: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever." [1720] And
   further on: "God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
   gladness above thy fellows." [1721] This God Who anoints, and God Who
   in the flesh is anointed, is the Son of God. For what fellows in His
   anointing hath Christ, except such as are in the flesh? You see, then,
   that God is by God anointed, but being anointed in taking upon Him the
   nature of mankind, He is proclaimed the Son of God; yet is the
   principle of the Law not broken.

   25. So again, when you read, "The Lord rained from the Lord,"
   acknowledge the unity of Godhead, for unity in operation doth not allow
   of more than one individual God, even as the Lord Himself has shown,
   saying: "Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me: or
   believe Me for the very works' sake." [1722] Here, too, we see that
   unity of Godhead is signified by unity in operation.

   26. The Apostle, careful to prove that there is one Godhead of both
   Father and Son, and one Lordship, lest we should run into any error,
   whether of heathen or of Jewish ungodliness, showed us the rule we
   ought to follow, saying: "One God, the Father, from Whom are all
   things, and we in Him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by Whom are all
   things, and we by Him." [1723] For just as, in calling Jesus Christ
   "Lord," he did not deny that the Father was Lord, even so, in saying,
   "One God, the Father," he did not deny true Godhead to the Son, and
   thus he taught, not that there was more than one God, but that the
   source of power was one, forasmuch as Godhead consists in Lordship, and
   Lordship in Godhead, as it is written: "Be ye sure that the Lord, He is
   God. It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves." [1724]

   27. "In thee," therefore, "is God," by unity of nature, and "there is
   no God beside Thee," by reason of personal possession of the Substance,
   without any reserve or difference. [1725]

   28. Again, Scripture speaks, in the Book of Jeremiah, of One God, and
   yet acknowledges both Father and Son. Thus we read: "He is our God, and
   in comparison with Him none other shall be accounted of. He hath
   discovered all the way of teaching, and given it to Jacob, His servant,
   and to Israel, His beloved. After these things He appeared upon earth,
   and conversed with men."

   29. The prophet speaks of the Son, for it was the Son Himself Who
   conversed with men, and this is what he says: "He is our God, and in
   comparison with Him none other shall be accounted of." Why do we call
   Him in question, of Whom so great a prophet saith that no other can be
   compared with Him? What comparison of another can be made, when the
   Godhead is One? This was the confession of a people set in the midst of
   dangers; reverencing religion, and therefore unskilled in strife of
   argument.

   30. Come, Holy Spirit, and help Thy prophets, in whom Thou art wont to
   dwell, in whom we believe. Shall we believe the wise of this world, if
   we believe not the prophets? But where is the wise man, where is the
   scribe? When our peasant planted figs, he found that whereof the
   philosopher knew nothing, for God hath chosen the foolish things of
   this world to confound the strong. [1726] Are we to believe the Jews?
   for God was once known in Jewry. Nay, but they deny that very thing,
   which is the foundation of our belief, seeing that they know not the
   Father, who have denied the Son. [1727]

    Chapter IV.

   The Unity of God is necessarily implied in the order of Nature, in the
   Faith, and in Baptism. The gifts of the Magi declare (1) the Unity of
   the Godhead; (2) Christ's Godhead and Manhood. The truth of the
   doctrine of the Trinity in Unity is shown in the Angel walking in the
   midst of the furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

   31. All nature testifies to the Unity of God, inasmuch as the universe
   is one. The Faith declares that there is one God, seeing that there is
   one belief in both the Old and the New Testament. That there is one
   Spirit, all holy, [1728] grace witnesseth, because there is one
   Baptism, in the Name of the Trinity. The prophets proclaim, the
   apostles hear, the voice of one God. In one God did the Magi believe,
   and they brought, in adoration, gold, frankincense, and myrrh to
   Christ's cradle, confessing, by the gift of gold, His Royalty, and with
   the incense worshipping Him as God. For gold is the sign of kingdom,
   incense of God, myrrh of burial. [1729]

   32. What, then, was the meaning of the mystic offerings in the lowly
   cattle-stalls, save that we should discern in Christ the difference
   between the Godhead and the flesh? He is seen as man, [1730] He is
   adored as Lord. He lies in swaddling-clothes, but shines amid the
   stars; the cradle shows His birth, the stars His dominion; [1731] it is
   the flesh that is wrapped in clothes, the Godhead that receives the
   ministry of angels. Thus the dignity of His natural majesty is not
   lost, and His true assumption of the flesh is proved.

   33. This is our Faith. Thus did God will that He should be known by
   all, thus believed the three children, [1732] and felt not the fire
   into the midst whereof they were cast, which destroyed and burnt up
   unbelievers, [1733] whilst it fell harmless as dew upon the faithful,
   [1734] for whom the flames kindled by others became cold, seeing that
   the torment had justly lost its power in conflict with faith. For with
   them there was One in the form of an angel, [1735] comforting them,
   [1736] to the end that in the number of the Trinity one Supreme Power
   might be praised. God was praised, the Son of God was seen in God's
   angel, holy and spiritual grace spake in the children. [1737]

   was one, was shown the Unity of power or nature. In another way, too,
   St. Ambrose points out, was the Trinity typified in that event,
   inasmuch as God was praised, the Angel of God was present, and the
   Spirit, or the Grace of God spake in the children.--H.

    Chapter V.

   The various blasphemies uttered by the Arians against Christ are cited.
   Before these are replied to, the orthodox [1738] are admonished to
   beware of the captious arguments of philosophers, forasmuch as in these
   especially did the heretics put their trust.

   34. Now let us consider the disputings of the Arians concerning the Son
   of God.

   35. They say that the Son of God is unlike His Father. To say this of a
   man would be an insult. [1739]

   36. They say that the Son of God had a beginning in time, [1740]
   whereas He Himself is the source and ordainer of time and all that
   therein is. [1741] We are men, and we would not be limited to time. We
   began to exist once, and we believe that we shall have a timeless
   existence. We desire after immortality--how, then, can we deny the
   eternity of God's Son, Whom God declares to be eternal by nature, not
   by grace?

   37. They say that He was created. [1742] But who would reckon an author
   with his works, and have him seem to be what he has himself made?

   38. They deny His goodness. [1743] Their blaspheming is its own
   condemnation, and so cannot hope for pardon.

   39. They deny that He is truly Son of God, they deny His omnipotence,
   in that whilst they admit that all things are made by the ministry of
   the Son, they attribute the original source of their being to the power
   of God. But what is power, save perfection of nature? [1744]

   40. Furthermore, the Arians deny that in Godhead He is One with the
   Father. [1745] Let them annul the Gospel, then, and silence the voice
   of Christ. For Christ Himself has said: "I and the Father are one."
   [1746] It is not I who say this: Christ has said it. Is He a deceiver,
   that He should lie? [1747] Is He unrighteous, that He should claim to
   be what He never was? But of these matters we will deal severally, at
   greater length, in their proper place.

   41. Seeing, then, that the heretic says that Christ is unlike His
   Father, and seeks to maintain this by force of subtle disputation, we
   must cite the Scripture: "Take heed that no man make spoil of you by
   philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, and
   after the rudiments of this world, not according to Christ; for in Him
   dwelleth all the fulness of Godhead in bodily shape." [1748]

   42. For they store up all the strength of their poisons in dialetical
   disputation, which by the judgment of philosophers is defined as having
   no power to establish aught, and aiming only at destruction. [1749] But
   it was not by dialectic that it pleased God to save His people; "for
   the kingdom of God consisteth in simplicity of faith, not in wordy
   contention." [1750]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1738] In the original Catholic, i.e. "Catholics." Heresies might
   become widespread--the Arian heresy, indeed, counted numerous adherents
   in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries--but they took their rise in
   some member or other of the ecclesiastical body, in some one of the
   many local churches which together made up the one oecumenical church.
   On the other hand, the primitive teaching, received from the apostolic
   age, had been delivered without difference in every place to which it
   had penetrated. It was acknowledged and established before sects and
   heresies; its original was divine, theirs only human; it rested on the
   rock of Christ's authority, speaking through His apostles, whilst they
   were built on the sands of preeminence in sophistry and captious
   interpretation; it was for all times and places, therefore, but they
   were only for a season. In this belief those who clave to the teaching
   of the apostles claimed for themselves the name of "Catholics," and for
   the oecumenical church of which they were members that of "Catholic and
   Apostolic." To avoid any misunderstanding, I have used the term
   "orthodox," which will stand very well for "Catholic," inasmuch as "the
   right faith" is for all, without difference, to hold--in a word,
   universal, or, as it is in Greek, kath' holou (whence katholikos,
   Catholicus, Catholic).

   [1739] It would constitute an insult, as suggesting that the man was a
   bastard, or supposititious.

   [1740] Thus the Arians were anathematized by the Nicene Council as
   "those who say that there was a time when the Son of God was not."

   [1741] The original was: "Cum conditor ipse sit temporum," which,
   rendered more closely word for word, is, "whereas He Himself is the
   ordainer of times," or "ages." The Latin tempora is the equivalent of
   the Greek aiones, which is commonly rendered "worlds" in the A.V. of
   the New Testament, e.g. Heb. i. 2; Rom. xii. 2; 1 Cor. i. 20; ii. 6; 2
   Cor. iv. 4; Gal. i. 4; 2 Tim. iv. 10. But aion also means "age"--"for
   ever and ever" is the rendering of eis aionas aionon ("unto ages of
   ages") or eis ton aiona. The term denotes the world as a complex, the
   parts of which are presented to us in succession of time, from which
   notion is derived its use to denote a selection of the parts so
   presented, collectively termed an "age" or "time." Another word
   rendered "world" in the N.T. is kosmos, which frequently occurs in St.
   John; and St. Paul also has it, in conjunction with aion in Eph. ii. 2.
   "According to the course (aiona) of this world (kosmou)." Kosmos means
   the world as an ordered whole, as opposed to a chaos. The use of
   "world" to translate both kosmos and aion may be justified on the
   ground that we cannot think of time void of objects and events, whilst,
   on the other hand, we know not--at least, have never observed--any
   objects and events not in time. For us "time" is a necessary form of
   thought.

   [1742] The Arians asserted that the Son had no existence before He was
   begotten and that He was "formed out of nothing" or "out of things
   non-existent;" i.e. that He owed His existence to the Father's absolute
   fiat, just as much as the light (Gen. i. 3). Furthermore, the Son's
   will was mutable; He might have fallen like Satan. The Father,
   foreseeing that the Son would not fall, bestowed on Him the titles of
   "Son" and "Logos."

   [1743] Arius' arguments against believing in Christ as the Almighty
   Power of God were based on the N.T. records of Christ's agony and
   prayer in view of death, which he thought must imply, not only
   changeableness of will, but also limitation of power. Had Christ been
   omnipotent, like the Father, He would have had no fears for Himself,
   but would rather have imparted strength to others.

   [1744] Arius' teaching on this head appears to be fairly enough
   represented by Athanasius: "When God, being purposed to establish
   created Nature, saw that it could not bear the immediate touch of the
   Father's hand, and His operation, He in the first place made and
   created a single Being only, and called Him Son' and Logos' to the end
   that by His intermediate ministry all things might henceforth be
   brought into existence." Contra Arianos, Oratio II. § 24.

   [1745] Christ, according to the Arians, was not truly God, though He
   was called God. Again, He was only so called in virtue of communication
   of grace from the Father. Thus He obtained His title and dignity,
   though the name of God was used, in speaking of Him in a transference,
   such as we find in Ps. lxxxii. 6; though Christ's claim to such a title
   far transcended any other.

   [1746] S. John x. 30.

   [1747] Num. xxiii. 19.

   [1748] It would, I think, be unfair to construe this passage into an
   absolute condemnation of all the results of human activity, arrived at
   without any conscious dependence on what we mean by revelation. We must
   remember, too, what "philosophy" was in the world into which St. Paul
   was born. It was no longer the golden age of philosophic activity--with
   the exception of Stoicism, there was hardly a school which exerted any
   elevating moral influence. Besides, the "philosophy" of which St. Paul
   was especially thinking when he wrote the passage cited (Col. iii. 8,
   9) was hardly worthy of the name. It was one of the earliest forms of
   Gnosticism, and among other practices inculcated worship of angels,
   i.e. of created beings--"Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues,
   Powers." See Col. i. 16-18; Eph. i. 20-22. Such "philosophies," falsely
   so-called, would tend to bring philosophy in general into disfavour
   with the teachers of the Church. Yet we find Eusebius, in the fourth
   century, calling the Faith "the true philosophy" (H. E. IV. 8). The
   adoption of the term to denote what St. Luke called "the way" (Acts
   xix. 23) appears to have been due to the action of apologists like
   Justin Martyr, who set themselves to meet the wise of this world with
   their own weapons, on their own ground.

   [1749] The original conception of Dialectic, as exhibited, for
   instance, in Plato's Republic, hardly answers to this. According to
   Plato, the aim of Dialectic, so far from being destructive, was
   distinctly edifying. The Dialectic method, as its name implies, was one
   which took the external form of question and answer. It had a definite,
   positive object, viz., the attainment by force of pure reason to the
   clear vision of the Absolute Good, the ultimate cause of knowledge and
   existence. The sphere of Dialectic was pure reason, then, and its
   object the ultimate truth of things. (Republic, VII. p. 532.) The
   method which St. Ambrose here calls "Dialectic" would have been more
   correctly entitled "Elenchus."

   [1750] 1 Cor. iv. 20. Cf. ii. 4, 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter VI.

   By way of leading up to his proof that Christ is not different from the
   Father, St. Ambrose cites the more famous leaders of the Arian party,
   and explains how little their witness agrees, and shows what defence
   the Scriptures provide against them.

   43. The Arians, then, say that Christ is unlike the Father; we deny it.
   Nay, indeed, we shrink in dread from the word. Nevertheless I would not
   that your sacred Majesty should trust to argument and our disputation.
   Let us enquire of the Scriptures, of apostles, of prophets, of Christ.
   In a word, let us enquire of the Father, Whose honour these men say
   they uphold, if the Son be judged inferior to Him. But insult to the
   Son brings no honour to the good Father. It cannot please the good
   Father, if the Son be judged inferior, rather than equal, to His
   Father.

   44. I pray your sacred Majesty to suffer me, if for a little while I
   address myself particularly to these men. But whom shall I choose out
   to cite? Eunomius? [1751] or Arius and Aëtius, [1752] his instructors?
   For there are many names, but one unbelief, constant in wickedness, but
   in conversation divided against itself; without difference in respect
   of deceit, but in common enterprise breeding dissent. But wherefore
   they will not agree together I understand not.

   45. The Arians reject the person of Eunomius, but they maintain his
   unbelief and walk in the ways of his iniquity. They say that he has too
   generously published the writings of Arius. Truly, a plentiful
   lavishing of error! They praise him who gave the command, and deny him
   who executed it! Wherefore they have now fallen apart into several
   sects. Some follow after Eunomius or Aëtius, others after Palladius or
   Demophilus and Auxentius, or the inheritors of this form of unbelief.
   [1753] Others, again, follow different teachers. Is Christ, then,
   divided? [1754] Nay; but those who divide Him from the Father do with
   their own hands cut themselves asunder.

   46. Seeing, therefore, that men who agree not amongst themselves have
   all alike conspired against the Church of God, I shall call those whom
   I have to answer by the common name of heretics. For heresy, like some
   hydra of fable, hath waxed great from its wounds, and, being ofttimes
   lopped short, hath grown afresh, being appointed to find meet
   destruction in flames of fire. [1755] Or, like some dread and monstrous
   Scylla, divided into many shapes of unbelief, she displays, as a mask
   to her guile, the pretence of being a Christian sect, but those
   wretched men whom she finds tossed to and fro in the waves of her
   unhallowed strait, amid the wreckage of their faith, she, girt with
   beastly monsters, rends with the cruel fang of her blasphemous
   doctrine. [1756]

   47. This monster's cavern, your sacred Majesty, thick laid, as
   seafaring men do say it is, with hidden lairs, and all the
   neighbourhood thereof, where the rocks of unbelief echo to the howling
   of her black dogs, we must pass by with ears in a manner stopped. For
   it is written: "Hedge thine ears about with thorns;" [1757] and again:
   "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers;" [1758] and yet again: "A man
   that is an heretic, avoid after the first reproof, knowing that such an
   one is fallen, and is in sin, being condemned of his own judgment."
   [1759] So then, like prudent pilots, let us set the sails of our faith
   for the course wherein we may pass by most safely, and again follow the
   coasts of the Scriptures. [1760]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1751] Eunomius, at one time Bishop of Cyzicus, came into prominence
   about 355 a.d. Like Arius, he taught that the Son was a creature,
   though the first and most perfect of God's creatures; His office being
   to guide other creatures to knowledge of the source of their existence.
   Religion then in his view consisted in a right and complete
   intellectual apprehension of a metaphysical principle, and no more. The
   generation of the Son he regarded as an event in time, not
   supra-temporal. The point where Eunomius went beyond Arius was the
   assertion of the comprehensibility for the human mind of the Divine
   Essence. Those, he said, who declared God to be in His Essence
   incomprehensible, who taught that He could only know in part and by
   token, preached an unknown God, and denied all possible knowledge of
   God, and therefore, since without knowledge of God there could be no
   Christianity, did not even deserve the name of Christians.

   [1752] Aëtius was Eunomius' teacher. He became Bishop of Antioch, the
   see of which was secured for him by the Arian Eudoxius, who obtained
   Cyzicus for Eunomius. Aëtius and Eunomius were, however, deposed about
   a.d. 360.

   [1753] Demophilus was Bishop of Constantinople under Valens (d. 378
   a.d.), but on the accession of Theodosius the Great he was compelled to
   resign the see, which was given to Gregory of Nazianzus.

   [1754] 1 Cor. i. 13.

   [1755] Hercules found it impossible to slay the Hydra (a monster water
   snake) of the Lernean marshes by merely striking off its head, inasmuch
   as whenever one was cut off, two immediately grew in its place. He was
   compelled to sear the wound with fire. One of the heads was immortal,
   and Hercules could only dispose of it by crushing it under a huge rock.

   [1756] For Scylla and Charybdis, see Homer, Odyss. XI.; Virgil, Æn.
   III. 424 f. The strait, bestrewed with wreckage of the faith (1 Tim. i.
   19) corresponds to the strait between the rock of Scylla and the
   whirlpool Charybdis. In order to avoid the latter, mariners were
   compelled to pass close under the former, whereupon the monster darted
   out and seized them, dragging them out of a ship as an angler whips a
   fish out of water (Odyss. XI. 251-255). The language of this passage
   shows plainly that St. Ambrose, in writing it, drew freely upon Virgil.

    Chapter VII.

   The likeness of Christ to the Father is asserted on the authority of
   St. Paul, the prophets, and the Gospel, and especially in reliance upon
   the creation of man in God's image.

   48. The Apostle saith that Christ is the image of the Father--for he
   calls Him the image of the invisible God, the first-begotten of all
   creation. First-begotten, mark you, not first-created, in order that He
   may be believed to be both begotten, in virtue of His nature, [1761]
   and first in virtue of His eternity. In another place also the Apostle
   has declared that God made the Son "heir of all things, by Whom also He
   made the worlds, Who is the brightness of His glory, and the express
   image of His substance." [1762] The Apostle calls Christ the image of
   the Father, and Arius says that He is unlike the Father. Why, then, is
   He called an image, if He hath no likeness? Men will not have their
   portraits unlike them, and Arius contends that the Father is unlike the
   Son, and would have it that the Father has begotten one unlike Himself,
   as though unable to generate His like.

   49. The prophets say: "In Thy light we shall see light;" [1763] and
   again: "Wisdom is the brightness of everlasting light, and the spotless
   mirror of God's majesty, the image of His goodness." [1764] See what
   great names are declared! "Brightness," because in the Son the Father's
   glory shines clearly: "spotless mirror," because the Father is seen in
   the Son: [1765] "image of goodness," because it is not one body seen
   reflected in another, but the whole power [of the Godhead] in the Son.
   The word "image" teaches us that there is no difference; "expression,"
   that He is the counterpart of the Father's form; and "brightness"
   declares His eternity. [1766] The "image" in truth is not that of a
   bodily countenance, not one made up of colours, nor modelled in wax,
   but simply derived from God, coming out from the Father, drawn from the
   fountainhead.

   50. By means of this image the Lord showed Philip the Father, saying,
   "Philip, he that sees Me, sees the Father also. How then dost thou say,
   Show us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the
   Father in Me?" [1767] Yes, he who looks upon the Son sees, in portrait,
   the Father. [1768] Mark what manner of portrait is spoken of. It is
   Truth, Righteousness, the Power of God: [1769] not dumb, for it is the
   Word; not insensible, for it is Wisdom; not vain and foolish, for it is
   Power; not soulless, for it is the Life; not dead, for it is the
   Resurrection. [1770] You see, then, that whilst an image is spoken of,
   the meaning is that it is the Father, Whose image the Son is, seeing
   that no one can be his own image.

   51. More might I set down from the Son's testimony; howbeit, lest He
   perchance appear to have asserted Himself overmuch, let us enquire of
   the Father. For the Father said, "Let us make man in Our image and
   likeness." [1771] The Father saith to the Son "in Our image and
   likeness," and thou sayest that the Son of God is unlike the Father.

   52. John saith, "Beloved, we are sons of God, and it doth not yet
   appear what we shall be: we know that if He be revealed, we shall be
   like Him." [1772] O blind madness! O shameless obstinacy! We are men,
   and, so far as we may, we shall be in the likeness of God: dare we deny
   that the Son is like God?

   53. Therefore the Father hath said: "Let us make man in Our image and
   likeness." At the beginning of the universe itself, as I read, the
   Father and the Son existed, and I see one creation. I hear Him that
   speaketh. [1773] I acknowledge Him that doeth: [1774] but it is of one
   image, one likeness, that I read. This likeness belongs not to
   diversity but to unity. What, therefore, thou claimest for thyself,
   thou takest from the Son of God, seeing, indeed, that thou canst not be
   in the image of God, save by help of the image of God.

    Chapter VIII.

   The likeness of the Son to the Father being proved, it is not hard to
   prove the Son's eternity, though, indeed, this may be established on
   the authority of the Prophet Isaiah and St. John the Evangelist, by
   which authority the heretical leaders are shown to be refuted.

   54. It is plain, therefore, that the Son is not unlike the Father, and
   so we may confess the more readily that He is also eternal, seeing that
   He Who is like the Eternal must needs be eternal. But if we say that
   the Father is eternal, and yet deny this of the Son, we say that the
   Son is unlike the Father, for the temporal differeth from the eternal.
   The Prophet proclaims Him eternal, and the Apostle proclaims Him
   eternal; the Testaments, Old and New alike, are full of witness to the
   Son's eternity.

   55. Let us take them, then, in their order. In the Old Testament--to
   cite one out of a multitude of testimonies--it is written: "Before Me
   hath there been no other God, and after Me shall there be none." [1775]
   I will not comment on this place, but ask thee straight: "Who speaks
   these words,--the Father or the Son?" Whichever of the two thou sayest,
   thou wilt find thyself convinced, or, if a believer, instructed. Who,
   then, speaks these words, the Father or the Son? If it is the Son, He
   says, "Before Me hath there been no other God;" if the Father, He says,
   "After Me shall there be none." The One hath none before Him, the Other
   none that comes after; as the Father is known in the Son, so also is
   the Son known in the Father, for whensoever you speak of the Father,
   you speak also by implication of His Son, seeing that none is his own
   father; and when you name the Son, you do also acknowledge His Father,
   inasmuch as none can be his own son. And so neither can the Son exist
   without the Father, nor the Father without the Son. [1776] The Father,
   therefore, is eternal, and the Son also eternal.

   56. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
   Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God." [1777] "Was,"
   mark you, "with God." "Was"--see, we have "was" four times over. Where
   did the blasphemer find it written that He "was not." Again, John, in
   another passage--in his Epistle--speaketh of "That which was in the
   beginning." [1778] The extension of the "was" is infinite. Conceive any
   length of time you will, yet still the Son "was." [1779]

   57. Now in this short passage our fisherman hath barred the way of all
   heresy. For that which was "in the beginning" is not comprehended in
   time, is not preceded by any beginning. Let Arius, therefore, hold his
   peace. [1780] Moreover, that which was "with God" is not confounded and
   mingled with Him, but is distinguished by the perfection unblemished
   which it hath as the Word abiding with God; and so let Sabellius keep
   silence. [1781] And "the Word was God." This Word, therefore,
   consisteth not in uttered speech, but in the designation of celestial
   excellence, so that Photinus' teaching is refuted. Furthermore, by the
   fact that in the beginning He was with God is proven the indivisible
   unity of eternal Godhead in Father and Son, to the shame and confusion
   of Eunomius. [1782] Lastly, seeing that all things are said to have
   been made by Him, He is plainly shown to be author of the Old and of
   the New Testament alike; so that the Manichæan can find no ground for
   his assaults. [1783] Thus hath the good fisherman caught them all in
   one net, to make them powerless to deceive, albeit unprofitable fish to
   take.

   [1776] This holds good also of human fatherhood and sonship. The terms
   of a relation involve each the existence of the other--no father, no
   son, and equally, no son, no father.

   [1777] S. John i. 1 f. St. Ambrose notices especially the quadruple
   "was" as unmistakably signifying the Son's eternity. We may also notice
   the climax "The Word was in the beginning....was with God....was God."

   [1778] 1 John i. 1.

   [1779] Hurter cites similar passages from the Fathers of the Church,
   proving the Son's pre-existence and eternity. "What is the force of
   those words In the beginning'? Centuries are o'erleaped, ages are
   swallowed up. Take any beginning you will, yet you cannot include it in
   time, for that, whence time is reckoned, already was."--Hilary.
   "Although the word was' contains the notion of time past, frequently
   with a beginning, here it must be understood without the thought of a
   beginning, inasmuch as the text runs was in the
   beginning.'"--Victorinus. If we render the Greek en arche and the Latin
   in principio by "at the beginning," in place of the phrase used in the
   A.V. "in the beginning," we shall perhaps better apprehend its full
   force and understand these Patristic interpretations. Other passages
   cited by Hurter are: "Thought cannot escape the dominion of the word
   was,' nor can the imagination pass beyond the beginning,' for however
   far back you press in thought, you find no point where the was' ceases
   to hold sway, and however diligently you set yourself to see what is
   beyond the Son, you will not any the more be able to get to aught above
   the beginning."--Basil. "For this which was, without any beginning of
   existence, was truly at the beginning, for if it had begun to be, it
   would not have been at the beginning,' whereas that in which absolute
   existence without beginning is essential, is truly spoken of as
   existing at the beginning.' And so the Evangelist in saying In the
   beginning was the Word' said much the same as if he had said The Word
   was in eternity.'"--Fulgentius. "If the Word was, the Word was not
   made: if the Word was made, He was not" [absolutely existent]. "But
   since He was' He was not made: for whatsoever already is and subsists
   and so is in the beginning' cannot be said to become or to have been
   made."--Cyril. "Nothing before a beginning, so the beginning be one
   really and truly, for of a beginning there can in no way be any
   beginning, and if anything else before it is supposed or arises, it
   ceases to be a true beginning.... "If the Word was in the beginning,'
   what mind, I would ask, can prevail against the power of that verb
   was'? When, indeed, will that verb find its limit, and there, as it
   were, come to a halt, seeing that it even eludes the pursuit of thought
   and outstrips the fleetness of the mind."--Cyril.

   [1780] The Arian teaching concerning the Son was--en pote hote ouk e
   "There was a time when He was not." This, St. Ambrose says, is
   irreconcilable with St. John's en arche en ho logos. "The Word was in'
   or at the beginning.'"

   [1781] Sabellianism reduced the distinction of three Persons in the
   Godhead to a distinction of several aspects of the same Person. They
   did not "divide the substance," but they "confounded the Persons."

   [1782] Non in prolatione sermonis hoc Verbum est. That is to say, the
   Divine Word or Logos was not such in the sense of logos
   prophorikos--i.e. uttered spoken word, and so a creature, but rather in
   the sense of logos endiathetos--the inherent eternal object of the
   Divine Consciousness. Cf. Eunomius (v. s. § 44), was a leading Arian
   teacher. The argument levelled against him here would also have been
   fitly directed against Arius himself.

   [1783] The heresy of Manes or Mani made its first appearance in Persia,
   in the reign of Shapur I. (240-272 a.d.). According to the Persian
   historian Mirkhond, Mani was a member of an ancient priestly house
   which had preserved the holy fire and the religion of Zoroaster during
   the dark age of Parthian domination. He attracted the notice of Shapur
   by pretensions to visions and prophetic powers, and sought to establish
   himself as another Daniel at the Persian Court. When the king, however,
   discovered Mani's hostility to the established Zoroastrianism and the
   Magian hierarchy, the prophet was obliged to flee. Northern India
   appears to have been Mani's refuge for a season, and thence, after some
   years of retirement, he reappeared, with an illustrated edition of his
   doctrines, composed and executed, as he said, by divine hands. Shapur
   was now dead and his successor Hormuz (272-274) was favourably disposed
   to Mani. But Hormuz only reigned two years, and was succeeded by a king
   who was a sworn foe to the new doctrine. Mani was challenged to a
   public disputation by the Magi. The king presided, so that Mani
   doubtless knew from the first what the issue would be. He was flayed
   alive, but he left numerous converts, and his death, which cast a
   certain halo of martyrdom around him, and their sufferings in
   persecution, really proved--as in the case of Christianity--conducive
   to the spread of Manichæan doctrine. The fundamental principle of
   Mani's system was Dualism--the opposition of mind and matter, and the
   hypothesis of two co-eternal co-existent powers of good and of evil. In
   opposition to the Divine Essence, the Good Principle, was placed
   uncreated Evil, and thus the problem of sin and evil was solved. The
   purposes of creation and redemption were, in the Manichæan view,
   entirely self-seeking on the part of the Deity. The world was created
   by God, not out of free love, but out of the wish to protect Himself
   against evil, embodied in matter, which in its essence is chaotic.
   Redemption was the rescue of particles of the ethereal Light, buried
   amidst the gross darkness of matter, and yet leavening and informing
   it. Christ was identified with the Divine Principle and the sufferings
   of His members, the particles of divine Light buried in matter, were
   the Crucifixion, thus represented as an age-long agony. Jesus Christ
   was "crucified in the whole world." Mani adopted the story of Eden, but
   he represented the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge not as
   the cause of Man's fall, but as the first step in redemption, for
   Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament, was not the true God, but the
   evil Demon, from whose tyranny man had to be rescued. In order to
   attain salvation, the body, material and therefore essentially evil,
   must be mortified and starved. Man really fell when Eve tempted him to
   indulge fleshly lust, not when he ate the forbidden fruit. The stricter
   sort of the Manichæans practised a severe asceticism, abstaining from
   flesh meat and marriage. They would not even grind corn or make bread,
   for in grain there was life--i.e. an emanation of the Divine
   Light--though they would eat bread, quieting their conscience, however,
   by saying before they took it, "It was not I who reaped or ground the
   corn to make this bread." At the end of time they held the world was to
   be destroyed by fire, but matter being, on the Manichæan hypothesis,
   eternal, the proper inference appears to be that the conflict of Light
   and Chaotic Darkness would recommence, and proceed usque ad infinitum.
   The Manichæan system was a strange eclectic farrago, embodying, in
   chimerical monstrosity, features of Zoroastrianism, Judaism (in so far
   as the story of Eden was taken over), Gnosticism (appearing in the
   theory that Jehovah was the Demon and that the eating of forbidden
   fruit did not cause the Fall), Christianity, and Pantheism (the last,
   doubtless, an importation from Hindostan). The disciples of the school
   made their way into the Roman Empire, and we find them, 150 years after
   the death of Mani, opposed by Augustine of Hippo, who indeed had at one
   time actually numbered himself amongst them.

    Chapter IX.

   St. Ambrose questions the heretics and exhibits their answer, which is,
   that the Son existed, indeed, before all time, yet was not co-eternal
   with the Father, whereat the Saint shows that they represent the
   Godhead as changeable, and further, that each Person must be believed
   to be eternal.

   58. Tell me, thou heretic,--for the surpassing clemency of the Emperor
   grants me this indulgence of addressing thee for a short space, not
   that I desire to confer with thee, or am greedy to hear thy arguments,
   but because I am willing to exhibit them,--tell me, I say, whether
   there was ever a time when God Almighty was not the Father, and yet was
   God. "I say nothing about time," is thy answer. Well and subtly
   objected! For if thou bringest time into the dispute, thou wilt condemn
   thyself, seeing that thou must acknowledge that there was a time when
   the Son was not, whereas the Son is the ruler and creator of time.
   [1784] He cannot have begun to exist after His own work. Thou,
   therefore, must needs allow Him to be the ruler and maker of His work.

   59. "I do not say," answerest thou, "that the Son existed not before
   time; but when I call Him "Son," I declare that His Father existed
   before Him, for, as you say, father exists before son." [1785] But what
   means this? Thou deniest that time was before the Son, and yet thou
   wilt have it that something preceded the existence of the Son--some
   creature of time,--and thou showest certain stages of generation
   intervening, whereby thou dost give us to understand that the
   generation from the Father was a process in time. For if He began to be
   a Father, then, in the first instance, He was God, and afterwards He
   became a Father. How, then, is God unchangeable? [1786] For if He was
   first God, and then the Father, surely He has undergone change by
   reason of the added and later act of generation.

   60. But may God preserve us from this madness; for it was but to
   confute the impiety of the heretics that we brought in this question.
   The devout spirit affirms a generation that is not in time, and so
   declares Father and Son to be co-eternal, and does not maintain that
   God has ever suffered change.

   61. Let Father and Son, therefore, be associated in worship, even as
   They are associated in Godhead; let not blasphemy put asunder those
   whom the close bond of generation hath joined together. Let us honour
   the Son, that we may honour the Father also, as it is written in the
   Gospel. [1787] The Son's eternity is the adornment of the Father's
   majesty. If the Son hath not been from everlasting, then the Father
   hath suffered change; but the Son is from all eternity, therefore hath
   the Father never changed, for He is always unchangeable. And thus we
   see that they who would deny the Son's eternity would teach that the
   Father is mutable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1784] Time. We should take this term in its fullest meaning, as
   signifying all that exists in time--the created universe, and all that
   therein has been, and is, and is to come.

   [1785] The Arians fell into the popular error of supposing that a
   father, as a father, existed before his son. They also required men to
   apply to Divine Persons, what only holds good of human beings--to
   impose on the Being of God those limits to which human existences (as
   objective facts) are subjected. The existence of the Divine Father and
   the Divine Son is without, beyond, above time--with the Godhead there
   is neither past nor future, but an everlasting present. But with man,
   time-categories are necessary forms of thought--everything is seen as
   past, present, or to come--and to the human consciousness all objects
   are presented in time, though the spiritual principle in man which
   perceives objects as related in succession, is itself supra-temporal,
   beholding succession, but not itself in succession. Now it can hardly
   be denied with any show of reason that a man is not a father until his
   son begins to exist, is born, though the father, as a person distinct
   from his son, is in existence before the latter. Again, father and son
   must be of the same nature--they must both possess the elementary,
   essential attributes of humanity. Otherwise there is no fatherhood, no
   sonship, properly speaking. God has revealed Himself as a Father--even
   in the pagan mythologies we see the idea of Fatherhood implicit in
   Godhead. If the gods of the heathen did not beget after their kind,
   they begat heroes and demigods. But created existences cannot claim to
   be the first and proper object of the Divine Father's love. They are
   for a time only, and with them Eternal Love could not be satisfied. If
   God be a true Father, then, He must beget His Like--His Son must be
   equal to Him in nature, that is, what is true of the Father, what is
   essential in the Father, as God, must be true or essential in the Son
   also. Therefore the son must be divine, eternal. But the generation
   (gennesis) of the Son is not an event in time. It is a fact, a truth,
   out of, beyond time, belonging to the divine and eternal and spiritual,
   not to the temporal and created, order. "To whom amongst the angels
   does He ever say, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee? and
   again, I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me? when,
   again, He brings His first-begotten into the world" (i.e., reveals Him
   to the created universe as its King), He says: "And let all God's
   angels worship Him" (Heb. i. 5-6). Since the Divine Son, then, is
   eternal, even as the Divine Father, the one cannot be before or after
   the other; the two Persons are co-existent, co-eternal, co-equal. And
   the mysterious genesis, also, is not an event that happened once,
   taking place in a series of events, it is ever happening, it is always
   and for ever.

   [1786] i.e., how do you deal with such Scriptures as "Thou art the
   same, and thy years shall not fail."--"I am the Lord: I change not,
   therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."--"The Father of lights,
   with Whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."

   [1787] S. John v. 23.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter X.

   Christ's eternity being proved from the Apostle's teaching, St. Ambrose
   admonishes us that the Divine Generation is not to be thought of after
   the fashion of human procreation, nor to be too curiously pried into.
   With the difficulties thence arising he refuses to deal, saying that
   whatsoever terms, taken from our knowledge of body, are used in
   speaking of this Divine Generation, must be understood with a spiritual
   meaning.

   62. Hear now another argument, showing clearly the eternity of the Son.
   The Apostle says that God's Power and Godhead are eternal, and that
   Christ is the Power of God--for it is written that Christ is "the Power
   of God and the Wisdom of God." [1788] If, then, Christ is the Power of
   God, it follows that, forasmuch as God's Power is eternal, Christ also
   is eternal.

   63. Thou canst not, then, heretic, build up a false doctrine from the
   custom of human procreation, nor yet gather the wherewithal for such
   work from our discourse, for we cannot compass the greatness of
   infinite Godhead, "of Whose greatness there is no end," [1789] in our
   straitened speech. If thou shouldst seek to give an account of a man's
   birth, thou must needs point to a time. But the Divine Generation is
   above all things; it reaches far and wide, it rises high above all
   thought and feeling. For it is written: "No man cometh to the Father,
   save by Me." [1790] Whatsoever, therefore, thou dost conceive
   concerning the Father--yea, be it even His eternity--thou canst not
   conceive aught concerning Him save by the Son's aid, nor can any
   understanding ascend to the Father save through the Son. "This is My
   dearly-beloved Son," [1791] the Father saith. "Is" mark you--He Who is,
   what He is, forever. Hence also David is moved to say: "O Lord, Thy
   Word abideth for ever in heaven," [1792] --for what abideth fails
   neither in existence nor in eternity.

   64. Dost thou ask me how He is a Son, if He have not a Father existing
   before Him? I ask of thee, in turn, when, or how, thinkest thou that
   the Son was begotten. For me the knowledge of the mystery of His
   generation is more than I can attain to, [1793] --the mind fails, the
   voice is dumb--ay, and not mine alone, but the angels' also. It is
   above Powers, above Angels, above Cherubim, Seraphim, and all that has
   feeling and thought, for it is written: "The peace of Christ, which
   passeth all understanding." [1794] If the peace of Christ passes all
   understanding, how can so wondrous a generation but be above all
   understanding?

   65. Do thou, then (like the angels), cover thy face with thy hands,
   [1795] for it is not given thee to look into surpassing mysteries! We
   are suffered to know that the Son is begotten, not to dispute upon the
   manner of His begetting. I cannot deny the one; the other I fear to
   search into, for if Paul says that the words which he heard when caught
   up into the third heaven might not be uttered, [1796] how can we
   explain the secret of this generation from and of the Father, which we
   can neither hear nor attain to with our understanding?

   66. But if you will constrain me to the rule of human generation, that
   you may be allowed to say that the Father existed before the Son, then
   consider whether instances, taken from the generation of earthly
   creatures, are suitable to show forth the Divine Generation. [1797] If
   we speak according to what is customary amongst men, you cannot deny
   that, in man, the changes in the father's existence happen before those
   in the son's. The father is the first to grow, to enter old age, to
   grieve, to weep. If, then, the son is after him in time, he is older in
   experience than the son. If the child comes to be born, the parent
   escapes not the shame of begetting. [1798]

   67. Why take such delight in that rack of questioning? [1799] You hear
   the name of the Son of God; abolish it, then, or acknowledge His true
   nature. You hear speak of the womb--acknowledge the truth of undoubted
   begetting. [1800] Of His heart--know that here is God's word. [1801] Of
   His right hand--confess His power. [1802] Of His face--acknowledge His
   wisdom. [1803] These words are not to be understood, when we speak of
   God, as when we speak of bodies. The generation of the Son is
   incomprehensible, the Father begets impassibly, [1804] and yet of
   Himself and in ages inconceivably remote hath very God begotten very
   God. The Father loves the Son, [1805] and you anxiously examine His
   Person; the Father is well pleased in Him, [1806] you, joining the
   Jews, look upon Him with an evil eye; the Father knows the Son, [1807]
   and you join the heathen in reviling Him. [1808]

    Chapter XI.

   It cannot be proved from Scripture that the Father existed before the
   Son, nor yet can arguments taken from human reproduction avail to this
   end, since they bring in absurdities without end. To dare to affirm
   that Christ began to exist in the course of time is the height of
   blasphemy.

   68. You ask me whether it is possible that He Who is the Father should
   not be prior in existence. I ask you to tell me when the Father
   existed, the Son as yet being not; prove this, gather it from argument
   or evidence of Scripture. If you lean upon arguments, you have
   doubtless been taught that God's power is eternal. Again, you have read
   the Scripture that saith: "O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto Me,
   there shall be no new God in thee, neither shalt thou worship a strange
   God." [1809] The first of these commands betokens [the Son's] eternity,
   the second His possession of an identical nature, so that we can
   neither believe Him to have come into existence after the Father, nor
   suppose Him the Son of another Divinity. For if He existed not always
   with the Father, He is a "new" [God]; if He is not of one Divinity with
   the Father, He is a "strange" [God]. But He is not after the Father,
   for He is not "a new God;" nor is He "a strange God," for He is
   begotten of the Father, and because, as it is written, He is "God above
   all, blessed for ever." [1810]

   69. But if the Arians believe Him to be a strange God, why do they
   worship Him, when it is written: "Thou shalt worship no strange God"?
   Else, if they do not worship the Son, let them confess thereto, and the
   case is at an end,--that they deceive no one by their professions of
   religion. This, then, we see, is the witness of the Scriptures. If you
   have any others to produce, it will be your business to do so.

   70. Let us now go further, and gather the truth in conclusion from
   arguments. For although arguments usually give place, even to human
   evidence, [1811] still, heretic, argue as thou wilt. "Experience
   teaches us," you say, "that the being which generates is prior to that
   which is generated." I answer: Follow our customary experience through
   all its departments, and if the rest agree herewith, I oppose not your
   claim that your point be granted; but if there be no such agreement,
   how can you claim assent on this one point, when in all the rest you
   lack support? Seeing, then, that you call for what is customary, it
   comes about that the Son, when He was begotten of the Father, was a
   little child. You have seen Him an infant, crying in the cradle. As the
   years passed, He has gone forward from strength to strength--for if He
   was weak with the weakness of things begotten, He must also have fallen
   under the weakness, not only of birth, but of life also.

   71. But perchance you run to such a pitch of folly as not to flinch
   from asserting these things of the Son of God, measuring Him, as you
   do, by the rule of human infirmity. What, then, if, while you cannot
   refuse Him the name of God, you are bent to prove Him, by reason of
   weakness, to be a man? What if, whilst you examine the Person of the
   Son, you are calling the Father in question, and whilst you hastily
   pass sentence upon the Former, you include the Latter in the same
   condemnation!

   72. If the Divine Generation has been subject to the limits of
   time,--if we suppose this, borrowing from the custom of human
   generation, then it follows, further, that the Father bare the Son in a
   bodily womb, and laboured under the burden whilst ten months sped their
   courses. But how can generation, as it commonly takes place, be brought
   about without the help of the other sex? You see that the common order
   of generation was not the commencement, and you think that the courses
   of generation, which are ruled by certain necessities whereunto bodies
   are subject, have always prevailed. You require the customary course, I
   ask for difference of sex: you demand the supposition of time, I that
   of order: you enquire into the end, I into the beginning. Now surely it
   is the end that depends on the beginning, not the beginning on the end.

   73. "Everything," say you, "that is begotten has a beginning, and
   therefore because the Son is the Son, He has a beginning, and came
   first into existence within limits of time." Let this be taken as the
   word of their own mouth; as for myself, I confess that the Son is
   begotten, but the rest of their declaration makes me shudder. Man, dost
   thou confess God, and diminish His honour by such slander? From this
   madness may God deliver us.

    Chapter XII.

   Further objections to the Godhead of the Son are met by the same
   answer--to wit, that they may equally be urged against the Father also.
   The Father, then, being in no way confined by time, place, or anything
   else created, no such limitation is to be imposed upon the Son, Whose
   marvellous generation is not only of the Father, but of the Virgin
   also, and therefore, since in His generation of the Father no
   distinction of sex, or the like, was involved, neither was it in His
   generation of the Virgin.

   74. The next objection is this: "If the Son has not those properties
   which all sons have, He is no Son." May Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
   pardon me, for I would propound the question in all devoutness. Surely
   the Father is, and abides for ever: created things, too, are as God
   hath ordained them. Is there any one, then, amongst these creatures
   which is not subject to the limitations of place, time, or the fact of
   having been created, or to some originating cause or creator. [1812]
   Surely, none. What, then? Is there any one of them whereof the Father
   stands in need? So to say were blasphemy. Cease, then, to apply to the
   Godhead what is proper only to created existences, or, if you insist
   upon forcing the comparison, bethink you whither your wickedness leads.
   God forbid that we should even behold the end thereof.

   75. We maintain the answer given by piety. God is Almighty, and
   therefore God the Father needs none of those things, for in Him there
   is no changing, nor any place for such help as we need, we whose
   weakness is supported by means of things of this kind. But He Who is
   Almighty, plainly He is uncreate, and not confined to any place, and
   surpasses time. Before God was not anything--nay, even to speak about
   anything being before God is a grave sin. If, then, you grant that in
   the nature of God the Father there is nought that implies a being
   sustained, because He is God, it follows that nothing of this sort can
   be supposed to exist in the Son of God, nothing that connotes a
   beginning, or growth, forasmuch as He is "very God of very God." [1813]

   76. Seeing, then, that we find not the customary order prevailing, be
   content, Arian, to believe in a miraculous generation of the Son. Be
   content, I say, and if you believe me not, at least have respect unto
   the voice of God saying, "To whom have ye esteemed Me to be like?"
   [1814] and again: "God is not like a man that He should repent." [1815]
   If, indeed, God works mysteriously, seeing that He doth not work any
   work, or fashion anything, or bring it to completion, by labor of
   hands, or in any course of days, "for He spake, and they were made; He
   gave the word and they were created," [1816] why should we not believe
   that He Whom we acknowledge as a Creator, mysteriously working,
   discerning it in His works, also begat His Son in a mysterious manner?
   Surely it is fitting that He should be regarded as having begotten the
   Son in a special and mysterious way. Let Him Who hath the grace of
   majesty unrivalled likewise have the glory of mysterious generation.

   77. Not only Christ's generation of the Father, but His birth also of
   the Virgin, demands our wonder. You say that the former is like unto
   the manner wherein we men are conceived. I will show--nay more, I will
   compel you yourself to confess, that the latter also hath no likeness
   to the manner of our birth. Tell me how it was that He was born of
   Mary, with what law did His conception in a Virgin's womb agree, how
   there could be any birth without the seed of a man, how a maiden could
   become great with child, how she became a mother before experience of
   such intercourse as is between wives and husbands. There was no
   [visible] cause,--and yet a son was begotten. How, then, came about
   this birth, under a new law?

   78. If, then, the common order of human generation was not found in the
   case of the Virgin Mary, how can you demand that God the Father should
   beget in such wise as you were begotten in? Surely the common order is
   determined by difference of sex; for this is implanted in the nature of
   our flesh, but where flesh is not, how can you expect to find the
   infirmity of flesh? No man calls in question one who is better than he
   is: to believe is enjoined upon you, without permission to question.
   For it is written, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him
   for righteousness." [1817] Language is vain to set forth, not only the
   generation of the Son, but even the works of God, for it is written:
   "All His works are executed in faithfulness;" [1818] His works, then,
   are done in faithfulness, but not His generation? Ay, we call in
   question that which we see not, we who are bidden to believe rather
   than enquire of that we see.

    Chapter XIII.

   Discussion of the Divine Generation is continued. St. Ambrose
   illustrates its method by the same example as that employed by the
   author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The duty of believing what is
   revealed is shown by the example of Nebuchadnezzar and St. Peter. By
   the vision granted to St. Peter was shown the Son's Eternity and
   Godhead--the Apostle, then, must be believed in preference to the
   teachers of philosophy, whose authority was everywhere falling into
   discredit. The Arians, on the other hand, are shown to be like unto the
   heathen.

   79. It will be asked: "In what sort was the Son begotten?" As one who
   is for ever, as the Word, as the brightness of eternal light, [1819]
   for brightness takes effect in the instant of its coming into
   existence. Which example is the Apostle's, not mine. Think not, then,
   that there was ever a moment of time when God was without wisdom, any
   more than that there was ever a time when light was without radiance.
   Judge not, Arian, divine things by human, but believe the divine where
   thou findest not the human.

   80. The heathen king saw in the fire, together with the three Hebrew
   children, the form of a fourth, like as of an angel, [1820] and because
   he thought that this angel excelled all angels, he judged Him to be the
   Son of God, Whom he had not read of, but in Whom he believed. Abraham,
   also, saw Three, and adored One. [1821]

   81. Peter, when he saw Moses and Elias on the mountain, with the Son of
   God, was not deceived as to their nature and glory. For he enquired,
   not of them, but of Christ, what he ought to do, inasmuch as though he
   prepared to do homage to all three, yet he waited for the command of
   one. But since he ignorantly thought that for three persons three
   tabernacles should be set up, he was corrected by the sovereign voice
   of God the Father, saying, "This is My dearly beloved Son: hear ye
   Him." [1822] That is to say: "Why dost thou join thy fellow-servants in
   equality with thy Lord?" "This is My Son." Not "Moses is My Son," nor
   "Elias is My Son," but "This is My Son." The Apostle was not dull to
   understand the rebuke; he fell on his face, brought low by the Father's
   voice and the glorious beauty of the Son, but he was raised up by the
   Son, Whose wont it is to raise up them that are fallen. [1823] Then he
   saw one only, [1824] the Son of God alone, for the servants had
   withdrawn, that He might be seen to be Lord alone, Who alone was
   entitled Son.

   82. What, then, was the purpose of that vision, which signified not
   that Christ and His servants were equal, but betokened a mystery, save
   that it should be made plain to us that the Law and the Prophets, in
   agreement with the Gospel, revealed as eternal the Son of God, Whom
   they had heralded. When we, therefore, hear of the Son coming forth of
   the womb, the Word from the heart, let us believe that the Son was not
   fashioned with hands but begotten of the Father, not the work of a
   craftsman but the offspring of a parent.

   83. He, therefore, Who said, "This is My Son," said not, "This is a
   creature of time," nor "This being is of My creation, My making, My
   servant," but "This is My Son, Whom ye see glorified." This is the God
   of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, Who appeared to Moses
   in the bush, [1825] concerning Whom Moses saith, "He Who is hath sent
   me." It was not the Father Who spake to Moses in the bush or in the
   desert, but the Son. It was of this Moses that Stephen said, "This is
   He Who was in the church, in the wilderness, with the Angel." [1826]
   This, then, is He Who gave the Law, Who spake with Moses, saying, "I am
   the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." This, then, is
   the God of the patriarchs, this is the God of the prophets.

   84. It is of the Son, therefore, that we read, thy mind understandeth
   the reading, let thy tongue make confession. Away with arguments, where
   faith is required; now let dialectic hold her peace, even in the midst
   of her schools. I ask not what it is that philosophers say, but I would
   know what they do. They sit desolate in their schools. See the victory
   of faith over argument. They who dispute subtly are forsaken daily by
   their fellows; they who with simplicity believe are daily increased.
   Not philosophers but fishermen, not masters of dialectic but
   tax-gatherers, now find credence. The one sort, through pleasures and
   luxuries, have bound the world's burden upon themselves; the other, by
   fasting and mortification, have cast it off, and so doth sorrow now
   begin to win over more followers than pleasure.

   85. Let us now see how far Arians and pagans do differ. The latter call
   upon gods, who are different in sex and unequal in power; the former
   affirm a Trinity where there is likewise inequality of power and
   diversity of Godhead. The pagans assert that their Gods began to exist
   once upon a time; the Arians lyingly declare that Christ began to exist
   in the course of time. Have they not all dyed their impiety in the vats
   of philosophy? But indeed the pagans do extol that which they worship,
   [1827] the Arians maintain that the Son of God, Who is God, is a
   creature.

    Chapter XIV.

   That the Son of God is not a created being is proved by the following
   arguments: (1) That He commanded not that the Gospel should be preached
   to Himself; (2) that a created being is given over unto vanity; (3)
   that the Son has created all things; (4) that we read of Him as
   begotten; and (5) that the difference of generation and adoption has
   always been understood in those places where both natures--the divine
   and the human--are declared to co-exist in Him. All of which testimony
   is confirmed by the Apostle's interpretation.

   86. It is now made plain, as I believe, your sacred Majesty, that the
   Lord Jesus is neither unlike the Father, nor one that began to exist in
   course of time. We have yet to confute another blasphemy, and to show
   that the Son of God is not a created being. Herein is the quickening
   [1828] word that we read as our help, for we have heard the passage
   read where the Lord saith: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
   Gospel to all creation." [1829] He Who saith "all creation" excepts
   nothing. How, then, do they stand who call Christ a "creature"? If He
   were a creature, could He have commanded that the Gospel should be
   preached to Himself? It is not, therefore, a creature, but the Creator,
   Who commits to His disciples the work of teaching created beings.

   87. Christ, then, is no created being; for "created beings are," as the
   Apostle hath said, "given over to vanity." [1830] Is Christ given over
   unto vanity? Again, "creation"--according to the same Apostle--"groans
   and travails together even until now." What, then? Doth Christ take any
   part in this groaning and travailing--He Who hath set us miserable
   mourners free from death? "Creation," saith the Apostle, "shall be set
   free from the slavery of corruption." [1831] We see, then, that between
   creation and its Lord there is a vast difference, for creation is
   enslaved, but "the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
   is, there is freedom." [1832]

   88. Who was it that led first into this error, of declaring Him Who
   created and made all things to be a creature? Did the Lord, I would
   ask, create Himself? We read that "all things were made by Him, and
   without Him was nothing made." [1833] This being so, did He make
   Himself? We read--and who shall deny?--that in wisdom hath God made all
   things. [1834] If so, how can we suppose that wisdom was made in
   itself?

   89. We read that the Son is begotten, inasmuch as the Father saith: "I
   brought thee forth from the womb before the morning star." [1835] We
   read of the "first-born" Son, [1836] of the "only-begotten" [1837]
   --first-born, because there is none before Him; only-begotten, because
   there is none after Him. Again, we read: "Who shall declare His
   generation?" [1838] "Generation," mark you, not "creation." What
   argument can be brought to meet testimonies so great and mighty as
   these?

   90. Moreover, God's Son discovers the difference between generation and
   grace when He says: "I go up to My Father and your Father, to My God
   and your God." [1839] He did not say, "I go up to our Father," but "I
   go up to My Father and your Father." This distinction is the sign of a
   difference, inasmuch as He Who is Christ's Father is our Creator.

   91. Furthermore He said, "to My God and your God," because although He
   and the Father are One, and the Father is His Father by possession of
   the same nature, whilst God began to be our Father through the office
   of the Son, not by virtue of nature, but of grace--still He seems to
   point us here to the existence in Christ of both natures, Godhead and
   Manhood,--Godhead of His Father, Manhood of His Mother, the former
   being before all things, the latter derived from the Virgin. For the
   first, speaking as the Son, He called God His Father, and afterward,
   speaking as man, named Him as God.

   92. Everywhere, indeed, we have witness in the Scriptures to show that
   Christ, in naming God as His God, does so as man. "My God, My God, why
   hast Thou forsaken Me?" [1840] And again: "From My mother's womb Thou
   art My God." [1841] In the former place He suffers as a man; in the
   latter it is a man who is brought forth from his mother's womb. And so
   when He says, "From My mother's womb Thou art My God," He means that He
   Who was always His Father is His God from the moment when He was
   brought forth from His Mother's womb.

   93. Seeing, then, that we read in the Gospel, in the Apostle, in the
   Prophets, of Christ as begotten, how dare the Arians to say that He was
   created or made? But, indeed, they ought to have bethought them, where
   they have read of Him as created, where as made. For it has been
   plainly shown that the Son of God is begotten of God, born of God--let
   them, then, consider with care where they have read that He was made,
   seeing that He was not made God, but born as God, the Son of God;
   afterward, however, He was, according to the flesh, made man of Mary.

   94. "But when the fulness of time was come, God sent His Son, made of a
   woman, made under the Law." [1842] "His Son," observe, not as one of
   many, not as His in common with another, but His own, and in saying
   "His Son," the Apostle showed that it is of the Son's nature that His
   generation is eternal. Him the Apostle has affirmed to have been
   afterwards "made" of a woman, in order that the making might be
   understood not of the Godhead, but of the putting on of a body--"made
   of a woman," then, by taking on of flesh; "made under the Law" through
   observance of the Law. Howbeit, the former, the spiritual generation is
   before the Law was, the latter is after the Law.

   [1842] Gal. iv. 4. Note on Gal. iv. 4, cited in § 94.--St. Ambrose has
   factum where St. Paul originally wrote genomenon, rendered "born" in
   the A.V. St. Paul designedly, perhaps, wrote genomenon, not
   gennethenta, the more usual word for "born." For gignesthai is used to
   denote other modes of beginning to exist, besides that in which animals
   are brought into life; it is used of inanimate, as well as animate
   existence--e.g., Mark iv. 37: "There ariseth (ginetai) a great storm of
   wind;" and thus we get the impersonal egeneto, "it came to pass,"
   simply signifying an order of events. The import, then, of the words
   factum ex muliere, genomenon ek gnnaikos, is that Christ, in being born
   in human form, "in the likeness of men," subjected Himself to the
   limits of human existence, "came into being," that is, in the sensual
   world. This was his self-emptying (Phil. ii. 7). Jesus, the man, the
   human person was made--"made man" (Nicene Creed)--was made "man of the
   substance of His mother" (Athanas. Creed); but by this "making," St.
   Ambrose points out, we must understand no more than the taking on of
   fleshly form. The Son, on the other hand, Who is God, never began to
   exist, as He will never cease; and even if He had not existed from
   eternity, He must have been pre-existent, in order to assume a fleshly
   form so that, in any case, birth of the Virgin does not affect His
   pre-existence as Son of God, whilst to say that He was ever "made" is
   to confound that birth with the Son's generation of the Father,
   eternity with time, the divine with the human order, the self-existent
   with the created.

    Chapter XV.

   An explanation of Acts ii. 36 and Proverbs viii. 22, which are shown to
   refer properly to Christ's manhood alone.

   95. To no purpose, then, is the heretics' customary citation of the
   Scripture, that "God made Him both Lord and Christ." Let these ignorant
   persons read the whole passage, and understand it. For thus it is
   written. "God made this Jesus, Whom ye crucified, both Lord and
   Christ." [1843] It was not the Godhead, but the flesh, that was
   crucified. This, indeed, was possible, because the flesh allowed of
   being crucified. It follows not, then, that the Son of God is a created
   being.

   96. Let us despatch, then, that passage also, which they do use to
   misrepresent,--let them learn what is the sense of the words, "The Lord
   created Me." [1844] It is not "the Father created," but "the Lord
   created Me." The flesh acknowledgeth its Lord, praise declareth the
   Father: our created nature confesseth the first, loveth, knoweth the
   latter. Who, then, cannot but perceive that these words announce the
   Incarnation? Thus the Son speaketh of Himself as created in respect of
   that wherein he witnesseth to Himself as being man, when He says, "Why
   seek ye to kill Me, a man, Who have told you the truth?" He speaketh of
   His Manhood, wherein He was crucified, and died, and was buried.

   97. Furthermore, there is no doubt but that the writer set down as past
   that which was to come; for this is the usage of prophecy, that things
   to come are spoken of as though they were already present or past. For
   example, in the twenty-first [1845] psalm you have read: "Fat bulls (of
   Bashan) have beset me," and again: [1846] "They parted My garments
   among them." This the Evangelist showeth to have been spoken
   prophetically of the time of the Passion, for to God the things that
   are to come are present, and for Him Who foreknoweth all things, they
   are as though they were past and over; as it is written, "Who hath made
   the things that are to be." [1847]

   98. It is no wonder that He should declare His place to have been set
   fast before all worlds, seeing that the Scripture tells us that He was
   foreordained before the times and ages. The following passage discovers
   how the words in question present themselves as a true prophecy of the
   Incarnation: "Wisdom hath built her an house, and set up seven pillars
   to support it, and she hath slain her victims. She hath mingled her
   wine in the bowl, and made ready her table, and sent her servants,
   calling men together with a mighty voice of proclamation, saying: He
   who is simple, let him turn in to me.'" [1848] Do we not see, in the
   Gospel, that all these things were fulfilled after the Incarnation, in
   that Christ disclosed the mysteries of the Holy Supper, sent forth His
   apostles, and cried with a loud voice, saying, "If any man thirst, let
   him come to Me and drink." [1849] That which followeth, then, answereth
   to that which went before, and we behold the whole story of the
   Incarnation set forth in brief by prophecy.

   99. Many other passages might readily be seen to be prophecies of this
   sort concerning the Incarnation, but I will not delay over books, lest
   the treatise appear too wordy

    Chapter XVI.

   The Arians blaspheme Christ, if by the words "created" and "begotten"
   they mean and understand one and the same thing. If, however, they
   regard the words as distinct in meaning, they must not speak of Him, of
   Whom they have read that He was begotten, as if He were a created
   being. This rule is upheld by the witness of St. Paul, who, professing
   himself a servant of Christ, forbade worship of a created being. God
   being a substance pure and uncompounded, there is no created nature in
   Him; furthermore, the Son is not to be degraded to the level of things
   created, seeing that in Him the Father is well pleased.

   100. Now will I enquire particularly of the Arians, whether they think
   that begotten and created are one and the same. If they call them the
   same, then is there no difference betwixt generation and creation. It
   follows, then, that forasmuch as we also are created, there is between
   us and Christ and the elements no difference. Thus much, however, great
   as their madness is, they will not venture to say.

   101. Furthermore--to concede that which is no truth, to their folly--I
   ask them, if there is, as they think, no difference in the words, why
   do they not call upon Him Whom they worship by the better title? Why do
   they not avail themselves of the Father's word? [1850] Why do they
   reject the title of honour, and use a dishonouring name?

   102. If, however, there is--as I think there is--a distinction between
   "created" and "begotten," then, when we have read that He is begotten,
   we shall surely not understand the same by the terms "begotten" and
   "created." Let them therefore confess Him to be begotten of the Father,
   born of the Virgin, or let them say how the Son of God can be both
   begotten and created. A single nature, above all, the Divine Being,
   rejects strife (within itself).

   103. But in any case let our private judgment pass: let us enquire of
   Paul, who, filled with the Spirit of God, and so foreseeing these
   questionings, hath given sentence against pagans in general and Arians
   in particular, saying that they were by God's judgment condemned, who
   served the creature rather than the Creator. Thus, in fact, you may
   read: "God gave them over to the lusts of their own heart, that they
   might one with another dishonour their bodies, they who changed God's
   truth into a lie, and worshipped and served the thing created rather
   than the Creator, Who is God, blessed for ever." [1851]

   104. Thus Paul forbids me to worship a creature, and admonishes me of
   my duty to serve Christ. It follows, then, that Christ is not a created
   being. The Apostle calls himself "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ,"
   [1852] and this good servant, who acknowledges his Lord, will likewise
   have us not worship that which is created. How, then, could he have
   been himself a servant of Christ, if he thought that Christ was a
   created person? Let these heretics, then, cease either to worship Him
   Whom they call a created being, or to call Him a creature, Whom they
   feign to worship, lest under colour of being worshippers they fall into
   worse impiety. For a domestic is worse than a foreign foe, and that
   these men should use the Name of Christ to Christ's dishonour
   increaseth their guilt.

   105. What better expounder of the Scriptures do we indeed look for than
   that teacher of the Gentiles, that chosen vessel--chosen from the
   number of the persecutors? He who had been the persecutor of Christ
   confesses Him. He had read Solomon more, in any case, than Arius hath,
   and he was well learned in the Law, and so, because he had read, he
   said not that Christ was created, but that He was begotten. For he had
   read, "He spake, and they were made: He commanded, and they were
   created." [1853] Was Christ, I ask, made at a word? Was He created at a
   command?

   106. Moreover, how can there be any created nature in God? In truth,
   God is of an uncompounded nature; nothing can be added to Him, and that
   alone which is Divine hath He in His nature; filling all things, [1854]
   yet nowhere Himself confounded with aught; penetrating all things, yet
   Himself nowhere to be penetrated; present in all His fulness at one and
   the same moment, in heaven, in earth, in the deepest depth of the sea,
   [1855] to sight invisible, by speech not to be declared, by feeling not
   to be measured; to be followed by faith, to be adored with devotion; so
   that whatsoever title excels in depth of spiritual import, in setting
   forth glory and honour, in exalting power, this you may know to belong
   of right to God.

   107. Since, then, the Father is well pleased in the Son; believe that
   the Son is worthy of the Father, that He came out from God, as He
   Himself bears witness, saying: "I went out from God, and am come;"
   [1856] and again: "I went out from God." [1857] He Who proceeded and
   came forth from God can have no attributes but such as are proper to
   God.

    Chapter XVII.

   That Christ is very God is proved from the fact that He is God's own
   Son, also from His having been begotten and having come forth from God,
   and further, from the unity of will and operation subsisting in Father
   and Son. The witness of the apostles and of the centurion--which St.
   Ambrose sets over against the Arian teaching--is adduced, together with
   that of Isaiah and St. John.

   108. Hence it is that Christ is not only God, but very God indeed--very
   God of very God, insomuch that He Himself is the Truth. [1858] If,
   then, we enquire His Name, it is "the Truth;" if we seek to know His
   natural rank and dignity, He is so truly the very Son of God, that He
   is indeed God's own Son; as it is written, "Who spared not His own Son,
   but gave Him up for our sakes," [1859] gave Him up, that is, so far as
   the flesh was concerned. That He is God's own Son declares His Godhead;
   that He is very God shows that He is God's own Son; His pitifulness is
   the earnest of His submission, His sacrifice, of our salvation.

   109. Lest, however, men should wrest the Scripture, that "God gave Him
   up," the Apostle himself has said in another place, [1860] "Peace from
   God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for our
   sins;" and again: [1861] "Even as Christ hath loved us, and given
   Himself for us." If, then, He both was given up by the Father, and gave
   Himself up of His own accord, it is plain that the working and the will
   of Father and Son is one.

   110. If, then, we enquire into His natural pre-eminence, we find it to
   consist in being begotten. To deny that the Son of God is begotten [of
   God] is to deny that He is God's own Son, and to deny Christ to be
   God's own Son is to class Him with the rest of mankind, as no more a
   Son than any of the rest. If, however, we enquire into the distinctive
   property of His generation, it is this, that He came forth from God.
   For whilst, in our experience, to come out implies something already
   existent, and that which is said to come out seems to proceed forth
   from hidden and inward places, we, though it be presented but in short
   passages, observe the peculiar attribute of the Divine Generation, that
   the Son doth not seem to have come forth out of any place, but as God
   from God, a Son from a Father, nor to have had a beginning in the
   course of time, having come forth from the Father by being born, as He
   Himself Who was born said: "I came forth from the mouth of the Most
   High." [1862]

   111. But if the Arians acknowledge not the Son's nature, if they
   believe not the Scriptures, let them at least believe the mighty works.
   To whom doth the Father say, "Let us make man?" [1863] save to Him Whom
   He knew to be His true Son? In Whom, save in one who was true, could He
   recognize His Image? The son by adoption is not the same as the true
   Son; nor would the Son say, "I and the Father are one," [1864] if He,
   being Himself not true, were measuring Himself with One Who is true.
   The Father, therefore, says, "Let us make." He Who spake is true; can
   He, then, Who made be not true? Shall the honour rendered to Him Who
   speaks be withheld from Him Who makes?

   112. But how, unless the Father knew Him to be His true Son, should He
   commend to Him His will, for perfect co-operation, and His works, for
   perfect bringing in out in actuality? Seeing that the Son worketh the
   works which the Father doeth, and that the Son quickens whom He will,
   [1865] as it is written, He is then equal in power and free in respect
   of His will. And thus is the Unity maintained, forasmuch as God's power
   consists in that the Godhead is proper to each Person, and freedom lies
   not in any difference, but in unity of will.

   113. The apostles, being storm-tossed in the sea, as soon as they saw
   the waters leaping up round their Lord's feet, and beheld His fearless
   footsteps on the water, as He walked amid the raging waves of the sea,
   and the ship, which was beaten upon by the waves, had rest as soon as
   Christ entered it, and they saw the waves and the winds obeying
   Him,--then, though as yet they did not believe in their hearts they
   believed Him to be God's true Son, saying, "Truly Thou art the Son of
   God." [1866]

   114. To the same effect the confession of the centurion, and others who
   were with him, when the foundations of the world were shaken at the
   Lord's Passion,--and this, heretic, thou deniest! The centurion said,
   "Truly this was the Son of God." [1867] "Was" said the centurion--"Was
   not" says the Arian. The centurion, then, with bloodstained hands, but
   devout mind, declares both the truth and the eternity of Christ's
   generation; and thou, O heretic, deniest its truth, and makest it
   matter of time! Would that thou hadst imbued thy hands rather than thy
   soul! But thou, unclean even of hand, and murderous of intent, seekest
   Christ's death, so far as in thee lies, seeing that thou thinkest of
   Him as mean and weak; nay, and this is a worse sin, thou, albeit the
   Godhead can feel no wound, still wouldst do thy diligence to slay in
   Christ, not His Body, but His Glory.

   115. We cannot then doubt that He is very God, Whose true Godhead even
   executioners believed in and devils confessed. Their testimony we
   require not now, but it is withal greater than your blasphemies. We
   have called them in to witness, to put you to the blush, whilst we have
   also cited the oracles of God, to the end that you should believe.

   116. The Lord proclaimeth by the mouth of Isaiah: "In the mouth of them
   that serve Me shall a new name be called upon, which shall be blessed
   over all the earth, and they shall bless the true God, and they who
   swear upon earth shall swear by the true God." [1868] These words, I
   say, Isaiah spake when he saw God's Glory, and thus in the Gospel it is
   plainly said that he saw the Glory of Christ and spoke of Him. [1869]

   117. But hear again what John the Evangelist hath written in his
   Epistle, saying: "We know that the Son of God hath appeared, and hath
   given us discernment, to know the Father, and to be in His true Son
   Jesus Christ, our Lord. He is very God, and Life Eternal." [1870] John
   calls Him true Son of God and very God. If, then, He be very God, He is
   surely uncreate, without spot of lying or deceit, having in Himself no
   confusion, nor unlikeness to His Father.

    Chapter XVIII.

   The errors of the Arians are mentioned in the Nicene Definition of the
   Faith, to prevent their deceiving anybody. These errors are recited,
   together with the anathema pronounced against them, which is said to
   have been not only pronounced at Nicæa, but also twice renewed at
   Ariminum.

   118. Christ, therefore, is "God of God, Light of Light, very God of
   very God; begotten of the Father, not made; of one substance with the
   Father."

   119. So, indeed, following the guidance of the Scriptures, our fathers
   declared, holding, moreover, that impious doctrines should be included
   in the record of their decrees, in order that the unbelief of Arius
   should discover itself, and not, as it were, mask itself with dye or
   face-paint. [1871] For they give a false colour to their thoughts who
   dare not unfold them openly. After the manner of the censor's rolls,
   then, the Arian heresy is not discovered by name, [1872] but marked out
   by the condemnation pronounced, in order that he who is curious and
   eager to hear it should be preserved from falling by knowing that it is
   condemned already, before he hears, it set forth to the end that he
   should believe.

   120. "Those," runs the decree, "who say that there was a time when the
   Son of God was not, and that before He was born He was not, and who say
   that he was made out of nothing, or is of another substance or ousia,
   [1873] or that He is capable of changing, or that with Him is any
   shadow of turning,--them the Catholic and Apostolic Church declares
   accursed."

   121. Your sacred Majesty has agreed that they who utter such doctrines
   are rightly condemned. It was of no determination by man, of no human
   counsel, that three hundred and eighteen bishops met, as I showed above
   more at length, [1874] in Council, but that in their number the Lord
   Jesus might prove, by the sign of His Name and Passion, that He was in
   the midst, where His own were gathered together. [1875] In the number
   of three hundred was the sign of His Cross, in that of eighteen was the
   sign of the Name Jesus.

   122. This also was the teaching of the First Confession in the Council
   of Ariminum, and of the Second Correction, after that Council. Of the
   Confession, the letter sent to the Emperor Constantine beareth witness,
   and the Council that followed declares the Correction. [1876]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1871] Fucus, the word used by St. Ambrose, denoted face-paint in
   general, but it seems to have also had the especial meaning of a red
   pigment, or rouge for the cheeks. The custom of face-painting was known
   of old in the East (2 Kings ix. 30; Ezek. xxiii. 40), whence, most
   probably, it passed into Greece--it was known, in Ionia at least, when
   the Odyssey was written (say 900 b.c.)--and thence to Rome. See Dict.
   Antiq. art. "Fucus."

   [1872] An allusion to the practice of the nota censoria. The censors,
   under the Republic, were vested with the power of appointing properly
   qualified citizens to vacancies in the Senate, and it was their duty to
   make up the roll of senators for each lustrum, or period of five years.
   Exclusion from the Senate was simply effected by omitting a senator's
   name from the new list, and senators so "unseated" were called
   præteriti, since their names had been passed over and not read out with
   the rest. The decrees of the Fathers of the Church laid down, as it
   were, the qualification for membership: all who came under the
   description established by these decrees were regarded as
   admitted--whilst those who, like the Arians, did not were tacitly
   excluded. Or we might say that the Anathema, appended to the Nicene
   symbol, excluded the Arians, not by name, but by description. In either
   way, the exclusion was tacit, like the censorial, in so far as no names
   were mentioned. In the case of exclusion from the Senate by the
   censors, it was understood that the reason for exclusion was grave
   immorality.

   [1873] St. Ambrose has here rendered into Latin the anathema appended
   to the original Nicene Creed of 325 a.d. Notice "substance or ousia."
   The original is substantia vel ousia. The closer Greek equivalent of
   substantia is hupostasis (found in Heb. i. 3, and translated "person"
   in A.V.), whilst the Latin for ousia is essentia ("essence"). St.
   Ambrose appears to regard ousia as a proper equivalent of substantia,
   whence we may perhaps infer that he also identified ousia and
   hupostasis in meaning. But some distinguished the two, using the term
   ousia in the sense of "essence" or "substance" (i.e., the Godhead) and
   hupostasis in that of "person"--so that, according to them, there would
   be three "hypostases" in the unity of the Godhead.

   [1874] Cf. §§ 3 and 5.

   [1875] S. Matt. xviii. 20.

   [1876] The Council of Ariminum (Rimini on the Adriatic coast of Italy)
   was held in 359 a.d., Constantius being Emperor. "The Bishops who
   attended the Council of Ariminum," observes Hurter, "to the number of
   more than 400, informed the Emperor that they had resolved to allow no
   change in what had been determined upon at Nicæa. This is the first
   confession.' That great confession, however, was not maintained for
   long. Partly overawed by the Emperor, partly deceived by the Arians,
   the Bishops agreed to strike out the words substance' and
   consubstantial.' After this came the correction,' which Ambrose calls
   the second,' being made either by those Bishops who, recognizing their
   error, withdrew the decrees of the Council held at Ariminum, or by the
   Councils that followed--namely, the Councils of Alexandria (presided
   over by Athanasius), of Paris (362 a.d.), and of Rome (held under Pope
   Damasus, in a.d. 369)."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter XIX.

   Arius is charged with the first of the above-mentioned errors, and
   refuted by the testimony of St. John. The miserable death of the
   Heresiarch is described, and the rest of his blasphemous errors are one
   by one examined and disproved.

   123. Arius, then, says: "There was a time when the Son of God existed
   not," but Scripture saith: "He was," not that "He was not."
   Furthermore, St. John has written: "In the beginning was the Word, and
   the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
   beginning with God." [1877] Observe how often the verb "was" appears,
   whereas "was not" is nowhere found. Whom, then, are we to believe?--St.
   John, who lay on Christ's bosom, or Arius, wallowing amid the outgush
   of his very bowels?--so wallowing that we might understand how Arius in
   his teaching showed himself like unto Judas, being visited with like
   punishment.

   124. For Arius' bowels also gushed out--decency forbids to say
   where--and so he burst asunder in the midst, falling headlong, and
   besmirching those foul lips wherewith he had denied Christ. He was
   rent, even as the Apostle Peter said of Judas, because he "bought a
   field with the price of evil-doing, and falling headlong he burst
   asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out." [1878] It was no
   chance manner of death, seeing that like wickedness was visited with
   like punishment, to the end that those who denied and betrayed the same
   Lord might likewise undergo the same torment.

   125. Let us pass on to further points. Arius says: "Before He was born,
   the Son of God was not," but the Scripture saith that all things are
   maintained in existence by the Son's office. How, then, could He, Who
   existed not, bestow existence upon others? Again, when the blasphemer
   uses the words "when" and "before," he certainly uses words which are
   marks of time. How, then, do the Arians deny that time was ere the Son
   was, and yet will have things created in time to exist before the Son,
   seeing that the very words, "when," "before," and "did not exist once,"
   announce the idea of time?

   126. Arius says that the Son of God came into being out of nought. How,
   then, is He Son of God--how was He begotten from the womb of the
   Father--how do we read of Him as the Word spoken of the heart's
   abundance, save to the end that we should believe that He came forth,
   as it is written, from the Father's inmost, unapproachable sanctuary?
   Now a son is so called either by means of adoption or by nature, as we
   are called sons by means of adoption. [1879] Christ is the Son of God
   by virtue of His real and abiding nature. How, then, can He, Who out of
   nothing fashioned all things, be Himself created out of nothing?

   127. He who knows not whence the Son is hath not the Son. The Jews
   therefore had not the Son, for they knew not whence He was. Wherefore
   the Lord said to them: "Ye know not whence I came;" [1880] and again:
   "Ye neither have found out Who I am, nor know My Father," for he who
   denies that the Son is of the Father knows not the Father, of Whom the
   Son is; and again, he knows not the Son, because he knows not the
   Father.

   128. Arius says: "[The Son is] of another Substance." But what other
   substance is exalted to equality with the Son of God, so that simply in
   virtue thereof He is Son of God? Or what right have the Arians for
   censuring us because we speak, in Greek, of the ousia, or in Latin, of
   the Substantia of God, when they themselves, in saying that the Son of
   God is of another "Substance," assert a divine Substantia.

   129. Howbeit, should they desire to dispute the use of the words
   "divine Substance" or "divine Nature," they shall easily be refuted,
   for Holy Writ oft-times hath spoken of ousia in Greek, or Substantia in
   Latin, and St. Peter, as we read, would have us become partakers in the
   divine Nature. But if they will have it that the Son is of another
   "Substance," they with their own lips confute themselves, in that they
   both acknowledge the term "Substance," whereof they are so afraid, and
   rank the Son on a level with the creatures above which they feign to
   exalt Him.

   130. Arius calls the Son of God a creature, but "not as the rest of the
   creatures." Yet what created being is not different from another? Man
   is not as angel, earth is not as heaven, the sun is not as water, nor
   light as darkness. Arius' preference, therefore, is empty--he hath but
   disguised with a sorry dye his deceitful blasphemies, in order to take
   the foolish.

   131. Arius declares that the Son of God may change and swerve. How,
   then, is He God if He is changeable, seeing that He Himself hath said:
   "I am, I am, and I change not"? [1881]

    Chapter XX.

   St. Ambrose declares his desire that some angel would fly to him to
   purify him, as once the Seraph did to Isaiah--nay more, that Christ
   Himself would come to him, to the Emperor, and to his readers, and
   finally prays that Gratian and the rest of the faithful may be exalted
   by the power and spell of the Lord's Cup, which he describes in mystic
   language.

   132. Howbeit, now must I needs confess the Prophet Isaiah's confession,
   which he makes before declaring the word of the Lord: "Woe is me, my
   heart is smitten, for I, a man of unclean lips, and living in the midst
   of a people of unclean lips, have seen the Lord of Sabaoth." [1882] Now
   if Isaiah said "Woe is me," who looked upon the Lord of Sabaoth, what
   shall I say of myself, who, being "a man of unclean lips," am
   constrained to treat of the divine generation? How shall I break forth
   into speech of things whereof I am afraid, when David prays that a
   watch may be set over his mouth in the matter of things whereof he has
   knowledge? [1883] O that to me also one of the Seraphim would bring the
   burning coal from the celestial altar, taking it in the tongs of the
   two testaments, and with the fire thereof purge my unclean lips!

   133. But forasmuch as then the Seraph came down in a vision to the
   Prophet, whilst Thou, O Lord, in revelation of the mystery hast come to
   us in the flesh, [1884] do Thou, not by any deputy, nor by any
   messenger, but Thou Thyself cleanse my conscience from my secret sins,
   that I too, erstwhile unclean, but now by Thy mercy made clean through
   faith, may sing in the words of David: "I will make music to Thee upon
   a harp, O God of Israel, my lips shall rejoice, in all my song to Thee,
   and so, too, shall my soul, whom Thou hast redeemed." [1885]

   134. And so, O Lord, leaving them that slander and hate Thee, come unto
   us, sanctify the ears of our sovereign ruler, Gratian, and all besides
   into whose hands this little book shall come--and purge my ears, that
   no stains of the infidelity they have heard remain anywhere. Cleanse
   thoroughly, then, our ears, not with water of well, river, or rippling
   and purling brook, but with words cleansing like water, clearer than
   any water, and purer than any snow--even the words Thou hast
   spoken--"Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as
   snow." [1886]

   135. Moreover, there is a Cup, wherewith Thou dost use to purify the
   hidden chambers of the soul, a Cup not of the old order, [1887] nor
   filled from a common Vine,--a new Cup, brought down from heaven to
   earth, [1888] filled with wine pressed from the wondrous cluster, which
   hung in fleshly form upon the tree of the Cross, even as the grape
   hangs upon the Vine. From this Cluster, then, is the Wine that maketh
   glad the heart of man, [1889] uplifts the sorrowful, is fragrant with,
   pours into us, the ecstasy of faith, true devotion, and purity.

   136. With this Wine, therefore, O Lord my God, cleanse the spiritual
   ears of our sovereign Emperor, to the end that, just as men, being
   uplifted with common wine, love rest and quietness, cast out the fear
   of death, have no feeling of injuries, [1890] seek not that which
   belongs to others, and forget their own; and so he, too, intoxicated
   with thy wine, may love peace, and, confident in the exultation of
   faith, may never know the death of unbelief, and may display loving
   patience, have no part in other men's profanities, [1891] and hold the
   faith of more account even than kindred and children, as it is written:
   "Leave all that thou hast, and come, follow Me." [1892]

   137. With this Wine, also, Lord Jesus, purify our senses, that we may
   adore Thee, and worship Thee, the Creator of things visible and
   invisible. Truly, Thou canst not fail of being Thyself invisible and
   good, Who hast given invisibility and goodness to the works of Thy
   Hands. [1893]
